it sounds amazing at first  
“don’t like a movie, game, or comic? just make your own!”  
with AI tools moving this fast, it really does feel like anyone can be their own personal studio

but that dream’s got a dark side.  
this isn’t just a creative revolution—this is a full-on society shake-up waiting to happen, and here’s why:

**creative careers get nuked**  
why would anyone hire an artist, composer, or writer when they can just prompt it in seconds?  
indie devs, animators, illustrators? yeah, gone.  
sites like fiverr, artstation, even youtube end up buried in auto-generated stuff

https://www.reddit.com/r/Realestate_Advocate/comments/1l722sz/what_are_some_of_the_worst_cities_to_buy_a_house/,climate change is real,What are some of the worst cities to buy a house due to facing a climate change real estate bubble?,"When it comes to cities facing a potential climate change real estate bubble, several locations stand out as particularly concerning based on my personal experiences.

# Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad in India are prime examples. These rapidly growing cities have seen rampant, unplanned development, often encroaching on natural flood plains and water bodies. As climate change brings more extreme weather events, these cities are increasingly vulnerable to devastating floods, which can severely impact property values.

Similarly, Chennai in India has a history of devastating floods that have submerged entire neighborhoods. The city's low-lying coastal location makes it highly susceptible to the effects of rising sea levels and storm surges.

Patna, another Indian city, is situated along the Ganges river basin, which is prone to annual flooding. As climate change exacerbates the intensity and frequency of these floods, homeowners in Patna face significant risks to their property investments.

Kolkata, also in India, is another coastal city grappling with the threats of climate change. Its proximity to the Bay of Bengal exposes it to the dangers of cyclones, storm surges, and sea level rise, all of which can severely impact real estate.

Lastly, Hyderabad, while not a coastal city, has experienced rapid urbanization and the loss of natural water bodies and green spaces. This has led to increased vulnerability to flash floods, which can devastate local real estate markets.

In these cities, the combination of climate change-related risks and unsustainable development patterns creates a perfect storm for a real estate bubble. Homebuyers should exercise caution and thoroughly research the long-term climate resilience of any property before investing.

https://www.reddit.com/r/chronoverse/comments/1kwnxlm/climate_change_fuels_spread_of_deadly_fungi/,climate change is real,Climate Change Fuels Spread of Deadly Fungi: Real-Life 'Last of Us' Scenario Unfolding,"A recent study from the University of Manchester has raised alarms about the global spread of Aspergillus, a genus of fungi capable of causing life-threatening infections known as aspergillosis. As climate change intensifies, these fungi are projected to expand into new regions, including North America, Europe, China, and Russia.

Key points from the study:

High Mortality Rates: Invasive aspergillosis has a mortality rate ranging from 20% to 40%, and in some cases, up to 85.2% .

Climate-Driven Spread: Rising global temperatures are enabling Aspergillus species to thrive in previously inhospitable regions, potentially exposing millions more people to infection .

Drug Resistance: Certain species, like Aspergillus flavus, have been classified by the World Health Organization as critical health risks due to their resistance to antifungal treatments .

Diagnostic Challenges: The symptoms of aspergillosis often mimic those of other respiratory illnesses, making early diagnosis difficult .


This scenario eerily mirrors the fictional fungal pandemic depicted in HBO's ""The Last of Us,"" but the threat is very real and growing. The study underscores the urgent need for increased research and public health preparedness to address the emerging risks posed by climate-driven fungal proliferation.

Taking the name Leo XIV, the new pope will certainly dominate at least a couple more news cycles as the interest in a Chicago-born pope continues for a few days.

If you've seen my other effortpost a few months back, you'll know that I took an interest in the subject of Francis' successor for a while. However, Prevost was not on my list of papabili. His name still comes as a shock to me, but admittedly his name was reported to have been increasingly gain traction by cardinals that wanted to continue Francis' legacy, according to some Catholic based media outlets .

In this effortpost, I'll go into Leo's background, and why I think he's a good bet for continuing the broad strokes of Francis' papacy: big focus on social and economic justice, while smacking down both conservatives within the church and right wing populists in the West.

#Leo's Background

Leo was born Robert Prevost in Chicago in 1955, to a father of French and Italian descent and a mother with some Creole and Afro-Haitian ancestry, among other things. He graduated from Villanova University in 1977 with a degree in mathmatics, and then was ordained a priest in 1982. He belongs to the Order of Saint Augustine, which has existed since the 1200s. Later in the 1980s, he began to increasingly be involved in the Augustinian mission in Peru, where he would remain for about a decade. In 2001 he became prior general of the Augustinians, making him their head. He would serve two six year terms in the role, being based in Rome but travelling the world to visit various Augustinian missions worldwide.

In 2014 Pope Francis picked him as the Bishop of Chiclayo, a city in northern Peru. He would remain there until 2023, when Francis named him the Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops. This is one of the most influential positions in the Vatican, as this department reviews candidates for new bishops and makes recommendations to the Pope (on paper the pope has the final say on all new bishops, but in practice he generally follows the Dicastery's suggestions). He was named a cardinal later that same year, initially as a cardinal-deacon but promoted to cardinal-bishop in January 2025.

Before Francis' death, Prevost was not on anyone's radar for a future pope. However, in the days between Francis' funeral and the 2025 conclave, he was named in some Catholic focused media outlets, such as The Pillar and National Catholic Reporter, as a name increasingly gaining traction among the cardinals. That being said, his American nationality was thought to be a major hurdle as the general line of thinking is that the cardinals are reluctant to pick a pope from the world's superpower, given the country's sheer dominance on the world stage and out of fear that an American pope would be likely to be drawn into the country's politics and culture wars, especially considering who the current POTUS and VP are. But his extensive time in Peru and Rome seems to have overcome these concerns, and the fact that he was elected in just four ballots suggests he had a strong showing from the first ballot and only gained votes from there.

#What signs are there that Leo XIV could be a pope similar to Francis?

There are three main things that I'm looking at that suggest Leo will be similar to the late Francis in at least some ways:his twitter account before becoming Pope, Leo's career during the Francis pontificate, and two key cardinals that are rumored to have supported Leo during the conclave votes.

#Prevost's Twitter history

Prior to becoming pope, Prevost/Leo maintained a twitter account called @drprevost as a bishop. He didn't tweet anything in 2024, but in 2025 tweeted five times. Two of these tweets were about Pope Francis' health, but the other three were criticisms of Trump and Vance. They were retweets of condemnations of the deportation of Kilmar Garcia and Vance's use of ""ordo amoris"" to justify caring less about immigrants than citizens. Notably, one of the latter retweets was from National Catholic Reporter,. or NCR.

NCR, as you might guess, focuses on Catholic related news, but isn't actually affilated with the Catholic Church due to being pretty left wing at times. Back in the late 60s, they published confidential reports showing that there was a lot of internal opposition to the publishing of Humanae Vitae (aka the RCC's current list of sexual no-no's that remains the standard to this day). So, not only did the new pope clearly condemn the Trump-Vance deportation agenda, he did so by at least once retweeting an article from a news source that represents the silent majority of left wing Catholics in the US, and one that has been even condemned as ""no true Catholic"" by a few bishops in America.

You think this might be a one-off where Prevost/Leo just happens to disagree on one thing with the new Trump administration, but there are even older retweets that suggest otherwise. These include retweeting Chris Murphy talking about gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, reposting outrage over the murder of George Floyd, and even more notably he's retweeted the Jesuit priest James Martin. Martin is well known within the Catholic world for perhaps being the RCC's most pro-LGBT cleric (while he's never outright called for gay marriage, everything else he says is very Episcopal sounding), to the point where right wing Catholics view him as a heretic. All of this, combined with the calling out of deportations, suggests someone who, if not a Democrat, clearly is disgusted by much of the social policy and cruelty of the Trump years, in line with Francis' statements during that time period. It's a clear difference with evangelicals and many right wing Catholics that are Trump supporters. While I expect Pope Leo to be cool and diplomatic with Trump and Vance, he'll likely take off the kid gloves when condemning right wing populism, like Francis before him.

#Prevost's career rise under Francis

The Prefect of the Dicastery of Bishops is, by it's very nature, one of the most powerful positions within the Vatican. Given how much religious authority a bishop has in his diocese, the person picking the men recommended for such positions is in a prime role to greatly influence the human resources policy and theological leanings of local churches around the world. Don't believe me? Look up both Robert McElroy and Raymond Burke and compare/contrast them. The former just got moved to the Archdiocese of Washington DC (almost certainly for the purpose of being a loud Trump critic for the next four years), while the former, a reactionary Benedict appointee, has been shut out of real influence for years but is a darling among the far right online Catholic community.

I cannot imagine Pope Francis, a man who was very progressive for a Catholic prelate and someone who tried to ""pack"" the College of Cardinals with men who supported his vision, would allow a secret conservative to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world. The previous prefect, Marc Ouellet, was a Benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a reward for delivering Francis the papacy in 2013. Ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75, and when he finally retired, I think Francis saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked Prevost out of Peru to carry it out.

The two past prefects, Giovanni Battista Re and Ouellet, were a seasoned Curia veteran and Archbishop of Quebec respectively. Both had experience running large church operations in prominent places. Leo, by contrast, was running a seemingly random diocese in Peru when called up by Francis. This suggests to me that Francis knew Leo's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be trusted to recommend bishop candidates that would carry out Francis' vision and spread his message around the world.

#Pierre and Cupich

Two notable cardinals in the Francis camp, per The Pillar, were arguing for votes to go Prevost's way before the conclave began: Christoph Pierre and Blase Cupich.

Born in France, Christoph Pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the United States (aka he's the Vatican's ambassador to the US). Before being assigned to DC in 2016, he was the nuncio to Mexico, and at the time the Mexican bishop's conference was considered to be among the most conservative in LATAM. Francis had a rough go with them in 2016 (google ""Francis rebukes Mexican bishops"" for more details). Pierre worked closely with Francis in ""dealing"" with them, and is generally thought to have done a good job as ambassador. After this, Francis reassigned him to DC, replacing the far right Carlo Vigano. Pierre now had the job of handling the infamously right wing USCCB and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country. (I should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they're stationed in, along with conducting interviews with people that know them, before passing on a shortlist of three names to the Dicastery of Bishops for their own decision-making.) Francis made the unusual move of giving Pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 (same year as Leo), and I suspect this was a reward for helping Francis in both America and Mexico.

Blase Cupich's supposed endorsement of Leo before the conclave, in my opinion and if true, is the single strongest piece of evidence that suggests to me that Leo will be a second Francis. Cupich is the current Archbishop of Chicago, but even before that he was showing signs of acting more like an Episcopalian than a Catholic. In Spokane, he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of Planned Parenthood (although he celebrated the overturning of Roe in 2022, like any Catholic bishop) and before that, in Rapid City, pushed back against the idea of denying Catholic Democrats the eucharist if they supported abortion. (Raymond Burke first brought up that idea over John Kerry being the Democratic nominee for president in 2004.)  As archbishop of Chicago, Cupich has eagerly gone after the Latin mass, supported gun control efforts, allowed his charity employees to help people register for health insurance under the ACA, pushed back against the USCCB's statement on Biden in 2020 (he said it ill-considered - I should mentioned it focused on abortion), and most notably delivered an invocation at the 2024 DNC. Given how much abortion rights were a major focus of Kamala Harris' campaign, conservative Catholics denounced Cupich doing this for reasons that don't need explaining. 

Cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to Francis, and supposedly had a say in the appointments of American bishops. For example, according to The Pillar he managed to get Cardinal McElroy the DC archdiocese, despite others making recommendations for moderate candidates. National Catholic Reporter also says that he and Prevost are close - probably a Chicago connection going on there, and I would assume Cupich first heard of Prevost not long after becoming Chicago's archbishop.

If one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the US was backing Prevost/Leo for the papacy, this had to have been a Francis continuity candidate in one form or fashion. I cannot imagine Cupich backing someone unless he was confident this candidate would continue most of Francis' agenda and theological focuses. Cupich isn't stupid enough to fall for a closeted conservative - it would be like Bush 41 nominating Souter for SCOTUS, and as we all know Souter turned out to be a liberal judge. As one of Francis' point men, Cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be willing to vote for, and Leo obviously made that list. The fact that Prevost was supposedly preferred as a ""Plan A"" over Tagle, a more obvious ""Francis continuity"" candidate, suggests that Prevost was comforably ""Francis-esque"" in Cupich's eyes.

#So what kind of pope will Leo XIV be?

This is the big question everyone is asking. Although Leo shares much in common with Francis, each pope tries to leave their own mark and blaze their own path. Benedict XVI, for example, was in some ways different in style and substance than John Paul II, despite being the latter's close advisor and a fellow conservative. I suspect Leo will be similar - following the broad strokes of the Francis papacy, while adding his own twist and style to it as he wishes.

Now, I don't expect Leo to be progressive right off the bat - he's on record opposing women deacons, is as anti-abortion as any Catholic prelate you can think of, and the onyl real record of him speaking on LGBT issues is from 2012, where he criticized support for ""homosexual lifestyles"" and from 2016, where he opposed Peruvian schools teaching about ""gender ideology"". However, it should be mentioned that Francis was opposed to Argentina's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 when he was an archbishop, and then became the pope most accomidating of LGBT people in history. Perhaps Prevost will be the same, over the course of many year of what could be a decade long pontificate or more.

In general, my current guess is that Leo will be slightly more conservative than Francis on gender and LGBT issues within the church. However, I expect him to go big on other issues Francis was popular in - immigration, fighting climate change, and social and economic justice. As a Peruvian bishop, Prevost/Leo strongly supported helping refugees from Venezuela arriving in the country, and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change, having said the church must move ""from words to action"" on the issue. The Leo XIV papacy will likely continue to move the RCC in the general direction that his predecessor began.

One other point I'd make, purely my guesswork and hypotheticals, is that I think Leo was voted for by at least a few of the progressive cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the USCCB for good. In most countries, the ""Bergoglian"" wing of the church is in command. The US is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case, probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning Roe and wanting to see abortion banned. The differences between the the American RCC and the RCC in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of people realize, and many loud critics of Francis came from American conservative Catholics. Francis made some steps to counter them (promoting Cupich and McElroy to the rank of cardinal, putting Prevost in the Dicastery of Bishops etc), but I suspect the real ""medicine"" will come with an American-born pope standing up to Trump's deportation cruelty on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall Bergoglian message. It'll be an interesting decade or so for Catholic politics and drama, no doubt.

As a Peruvian bishop, Prevost/Leo strongly supported helping refugees from Venezuela arriving in the country, and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change, having said the church must move ""from words to action"" on the issue. The Leo XIV papacy will likely continue to move the RCC in the general direction that his predecessor began.

One other point I'd make, purely my guesswork and hypotheticals, is that I think Leo was voted for by at least a few of the progressive cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the USCCB for good. In most countries, the ""Bergoglian"" wing of the church is in command. The US is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case, probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning Roe and wanting to see abortion banned. The differences between the the American RCC and the RCC in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of people realize, and many loud critics of Francis came from American conservative Catholics. Francis made some steps to counter them (promoting Cupich and McElroy to the rank of cardinal, putting Prevost in the Dicastery of Bishops etc), but I suspect the real ""medicine"" will come with an American-born pope standing up to Trump's deportation cruelty on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall Bergoglian message. It'll be an interesting decade or so for Catholic politics and drama, no doubt.

look up both robert mcelroy and raymond burke and compare/contrast them . the former just got moved to the archdiocese of washington dc ( almost certainly for the purpose of being a for the next four years ) , while the former , a benedict appointee , has been shut out of real influence for years but is a among the far online catholic community . i can not imagine pope francis , a man who was very for a catholic prelate and someone who tried to `` pack '' the college of cardinals with men who his vision , would allow a secret to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world . the previous prefect , marc ouellet , was a benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a for delivering francis the papacy in 2013. ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75 , and when he finally retired , i think francis saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked prevost out of peru to carry it out . the two past prefects , giovanni battista re and ouellet , were a curia veteran and archbishop of quebec respectively . both had experience running large church operations in places . leo , by contrast , was running a seemingly random diocese in peru when called up by francis . this suggests to me that francis knew leo 's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be to bishop candidates that would carry out francis ' vision and spread his message around the world . # pierre and cupich two notable cardinals in the francis camp , per the pillar , were arguing for votes to go prevost 's way before the conclave began : christoph pierre and blase cupich . born in france , christoph pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the united states ( aka he 's the vatican 's ambassador to the us ) . before being assigned to dc in 2016 , he was the nuncio to mexico , and at the time the mexican bishop 's conference was considered to be among the most in latam . francis had a go with them in 2016 ( google `` francis rebukes mexican bishops '' for more details ) . pierre closely with francis in `` dealing '' with them , and is generally thought to have done a job as ambassador . after this , francis reassigned him to dc , replacing the far carlo vigano . pierre now had the job of handling the wing usccb and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country . ( i should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they 're stationed in , along with conducting interviews with people that know them , before passing on a shortlist of three names to the dicastery of bishops for their own decision-making . ) francis made the move of giving pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 ( same year as leo ) , and i this was a for francis in both america and mexico . blase cupich 's supposed of leo before the conclave , in my opinion and if true , is the single piece of evidence that suggests to me that leo will be a second francis . cupich is the current archbishop of chicago , but even before that he was showing signs of acting more an episcopalian than a catholic . in spokane , he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of planned parenthood ( although he the overturning of roe in 2022 , any catholic bishop ) and before that , in city , pushed back against the idea of catholic democrats the eucharist if they abortion . ( raymond burke first brought up that idea over john kerry being the democratic nominee for president in 2004 . ) as archbishop of chicago , cupich has gone after the latin mass , gun control efforts , allowed his charity employees to help people register for health insurance under the aca , pushed back against the usccb 's statement on biden in 2020 ( he said it ill-considered - i should mentioned it focused on abortion ) , and most delivered an invocation at the 2024 dnc . given how much abortion rights were a major focus of kamala harris ' campaign , catholics denounced cupich doing this for reasons that do n't need explaining . cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to francis , and supposedly had a say in the appointments of american bishops . for example , according to the pillar he managed to get cardinal mcelroy the dc archdiocese , despite others making for moderate candidates . national catholic reporter also says that he and prevost are close - probably a chicago connection going on there , and i would assume cupich first heard of prevost not long after becoming chicago 's archbishop . if one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the us was backing prevost/leo for the papacy , this had to have been a francis candidate in one form or fashion . i can not imagine cupich backing someone unless he was this candidate would continue most of francis ' agenda and theological focuses . cupich is n't to for a closeted - it would be bush 41 nominating souter for scotus , and as we all know souter turned out to be a liberal judge . as one of francis ' point men , cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be to vote for , and leo obviously made that list . the fact that prevost was supposedly preferred as a `` plan a '' over tagle , a more obvious `` francis '' candidate , suggests that prevost was comforably `` francis-esque '' in cupich 's eyes . # so what kind of pope will leo xiv be ?

Taking the name Leo XIV, the new pope will certainly dominate at least a couple more news cycles as the interest in a Chicago-born pope continues for a few days.

If you've seen my other effortpost a few months back, you'll know that I took an interest in the subject of Francis' successor for a while. However, Prevost was not on my list of papabili. His name still comes as a shock to me, but admittedly his name was reported to have been increasingly gain traction by cardinals that wanted to continue Francis' legacy, according to some Catholic based media outlets .

In this effortpost, I'll go into Leo's background, and why I think he's a good bet for continuing the broad strokes of Francis' papacy: big focus on social and economic justice, while smacking down both conservatives within the church and  wing populists in the West.

#Leo's Background

Leo was born Robert Prevost in Chicago in 1955, to a father of French and Italian descent and a mother with some Creole and Afro-Haitian ancestry, among other things. He graduated from Villanova University in 1977 with a degree in mathmatics, and then was ordained a priest in 1982. He belongs to the Order of Saint Augustine, which has existed since the 1200s. Later in the 1980s, he began to increasingly be involved in the Augustinian mission in Peru, where he would remain for about a decade. In 2001 he became prior general of the Augustinians, making him their head. He would serve two six year terms in the role, being based in Rome but travelling the world to visit various Augustinian missions worldwide.

In 2014 Pope Francis picked him as the Bishop of Chiclayo, a city in northern Peru. He would remain there until 2023, when Francis named him the Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops. This is one of the most influential positions in the Vatican, as this department reviews candidates for new bishops and makes recommendations to the Pope (on paper the pope has the final say on all new bishops, but in practice he generally follows the Dicastery's suggestions). He was named a cardinal later that same year, initially as a cardinal-deacon but promoted to cardinal-bishop in January 2025.

Before Francis' death, Prevost was not on anyone's radar for a future pope. However, in the days between Francis' funeral and the 2025 conclave, he was named in some Catholic focused media outlets, such as The Pillar and National Catholic Reporter, as a name increasingly gaining traction among the cardinals. That being said, his American nationality was thought to be a major hurdle as the general line of thinking is that the cardinals are reluctant to pick a pope from the world's superpower, given the country's sheer dominance on the world stage and out of fear that an American pope would be likely to be drawn into the country's politics and culture wars, especially considering who the current POTUS and VP are. But his extensive time in Peru and Rome seems to have overcome these concerns, and the fact that he was elected in  four ballots suggests he had a strong showing from the first ballot and only gained votes from there.

#What signs are there that Leo XIV could be a pope similar to Francis?

There are three main things that I'm looking at that suggest Leo will be similar to the late Francis in at least some ways:his twitter account before becoming Pope, Leo's career during the Francis pontificate, and two key cardinals that are rumored to have supported Leo during the conclave votes.

#Prevost's Twitter history

Prior to becoming pope, Prevost/Leo maintained a twitter account called @drprevost as a bishop. He didn't tweet anything in 2024, but in 2025 tweeted five times. Two of these tweets were about Pope Francis' health, but the other three were criticisms of  and Vance. They were retweets of condemnations of the deportation of Kilmar Garcia and Vance's use of ""ordo amoris"" to justify caring less about immigrants than citizens. Notably, one of the latter retweets was from National Catholic Reporter,. or NCR.

NCR, as you might guess, focuses on Catholic related news, but isn't actually affilated with the Catholic Church due to being pretty left wing at times. Back in the late 60s, they published confidential reports showing that there was a lot of internal opposition to the publishing of Humanae Vitae (aka the RCC's current list of sexual no-no's that remains the standard to this day). So, not only did the new pope clearly condemn the -Vance deportation agenda, he did so by at least once retweeting an article from a news source that represents the silent majority of left wing Catholics in the US, and one that has been even condemned as ""no true Catholic"" by a few bishops in America.

You think this might be a one-off where Prevost/Leo  happens to disagree on one thing with the new  administration, but there are even older retweets that suggest otherwise. These include retweeting Chris Murphy talking about gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, reposting outrage over the murder of George Floyd, and even more notably he's retweeted the Jesuit priest James Martin. Martin is well known within the Catholic world for perhaps being the RCC's most pro-LGBT cleric (while he's never outright called for gay marriage, everything else he says is very Episcopal sounding), to the point where  wing Catholics view him as a heretic. All of this, combined with the calling out of deportations, suggests someone who, if not a Democrat, clearly is disgusted by much of the social policy and cruelty of the  years, in line with Francis' statements during that time period. It's a clear difference with evangelicals and many  wing Catholics that are  supporters. While I expect Pope Leo to be cool and diplomatic with  and Vance, he'll likely take off the kid gloves when condemning  wing populism, like Francis before him.

#Prevost's career rise under Francis

The Prefect of the Dicastery of Bishops is, by it's very nature, one of the most powerful positions within the Vatican. Given how much religious authority a bishop has in his diocese, the person picking the men recommended for such positions is in a prime role to greatly influence the human resources policy and theological leanings of local churches around the world. 't believe me? Look up both Robert McElroy and Raymond Burke and compare/contrast them. The former  got moved to the Archdiocese of Washington DC (almost certainly for the purpose of being a loud  critic for the next four years), while the former, a reactionary Benedict appointee, has been shut out of  influence for years but is a darling among the far  online Catholic community.

I cannot imagine Pope Francis, a man who was very progressive for a Catholic prelate and someone who tried to ""pack"" the College of Cardinals with men who supported his vision, would allow a secret conservative to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world. The previous prefect, Marc Ouellet, was a Benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a reward for delivering Francis the papacy in 2013. Ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75, and when he finally retired, I think Francis saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked Prevost out of Peru to carry it out.

The two past prefects, Giovanni Battista Re and Ouellet, were a seasoned Curia veteran and Archbishop of Quebec respectively. Both had experience running large church operations in prominent places. Leo, by contrast, was running a seemingly random diocese in Peru when called up by Francis. This suggests to me that Francis knew Leo's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be trusted to recommend bishop candidates that would carry out Francis' vision and spread his message around the world.

#Pierre and Cupich

Two notable cardinals in the Francis camp, per The Pillar, were arguing for votes to go Prevost's way before the conclave began: Christoph Pierre and Blase Cupich.

Born in France, Christoph Pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the United States (aka he's the Vatican's ambassador to the US). Before being assigned to DC in 2016, he was the nuncio to Mexico, and at the time the Mexican bishop's conference was considered to be among the most conservative in LATAM. Francis had a rough go with them in 2016 (google ""Francis rebukes Mexican bishops"" for more details). Pierre worked closely with Francis in ""dealing"" with them, and is generally thought to have done a good job as ambassador. After this, Francis reassigned him to DC, replacing the far  Carlo Vigano. Pierre now had the job of handling the infamously  wing USCCB and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country. (I should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they're stationed in, along with conducting interviews with  that know them, before passing on a shortlist of three names to the Dicastery of Bishops for their own decision-making.) Francis made the unusual move of giving Pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 (same year as Leo), and I suspect this was a reward for helping Francis in both America and Mexico.

Blase Cupich's supposed endorsement of Leo before the conclave, in my opinion and if true, is the single strongest piece of evidence that suggests to me that Leo will be a second Francis. Cupich is the current Archbishop of Chicago, but even before that he was showing signs of acting more like an Episcopalian than a Catholic. In Spokane, he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of Planned Parenthood (although he celebrated the overturning of Roe in 2022, like any Catholic bishop) and before that, in Rapid City, pushed back against the idea of denying Catholic Democrats the eucharist if they supported abortion. (Raymond Burke first brought up that idea over John Kerry being the Democratic nominee for president in 2004.)  As archbishop of Chicago, Cupich has eagerly gone after the Latin mass, supported gun control efforts, allowed his charity employees to help  register for health insurance under the ACA, pushed back against the USCCB's statement on Biden in 2020 (he said it ill-considered - I should mentioned it focused on abortion), and most notably delivered an invocation at the 2024 DNC. Given how much abortion rights were a major focus of Kamala Harris' campaign, conservative Catholics denounced Cupich doing this for reasons that 't need explaining. 

Cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to Francis, and supposedly had a say in the appointments of American bishops. For example, according to The Pillar he managed to get Cardinal McElroy the DC archdiocese, despite others making recommendations for moderate candidates. National Catholic Reporter also says that he and Prevost are close - probably a Chicago connection going on there, and I would assume Cupich first heard of Prevost not long after becoming Chicago's archbishop.

If one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the US was backing Prevost/Leo for the papacy, this had to have been a Francis continuity candidate in one form or fashion. I cannot imagine Cupich backing someone unless he was confident this candidate would continue most of Francis' agenda and theological focuses. Cupich isn't stupid enough to fall for a closeted conservative - it would be like Bush 41 nominating Souter for SCOTUS, and as we all know Souter turned out to be a liberal judge. As one of Francis' point men, Cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be willing to vote for, and Leo obviously made that list. The fact that Prevost was supposedly preferred as a ""Plan A"" over Tagle, a more obvious ""Francis continuity"" candidate, suggests that Prevost was comforably ""Francis-esque"" in Cupich's eyes.

#So what kind of pope will Leo XIV be?

This is the big question everyone is asking. Although Leo shares much in common with Francis, each pope tries to leave their own mark and blaze their own path. Benedict XVI, for example, was in some ways different in style and substance than John Paul II, despite being the latter's close advisor and a fellow conservative. I suspect Leo will be similar - following the broad strokes of the Francis papacy, while adding his own twist and style to it as he wishes.

Now, I 't expect Leo to be progressive  off the bat - he's on record opposing women deacons, is as anti-abortion as any Catholic prelate you can think of, and the onyl  record of him speaking on LGBT issues is from 2012, where he criticized support for ""homosexual lifestyles"" and from 2016, where he opposed Peruvian schools teaching about ""gender ideology"". However, it should be mentioned that Francis was opposed to Argentina's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 when he was an archbishop, and then became the pope most accomidating of LGBT  in history. Perhaps Prevost will be the same, over the course of many year of what could be a decade long pontificate or more.

In general, my current guess is that Leo will be slightly more conservative than Francis on gender and LGBT issues within the church. However, I expect him to go big on other issues Francis was popular in - immigration, fighting climate change, and social and economic justice. As a Peruvian bishop, Prevost/Leo strongly supported helping refugees from Venezuela arriving in the country, and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change, having said the church must move ""from words to action"" on the issue. The Leo XIV papacy will likely continue to move the RCC in the general direction that his predecessor began.

One other point I'd make, purely my guesswork and hypotheticals, is that I think Leo was voted for by at least a few of the progressive cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the USCCB for good. In most countries, the ""Bergoglian"" wing of the church is in command. The US is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case, probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning Roe and wanting to see abortion banned. The differences between the the American RCC and the RCC in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of  realize, and many loud critics of Francis came from American conservative Catholics. Francis made some steps to counter them (promoting Cupich and McElroy to the rank of cardinal, putting Prevost in the Dicastery of Bishops etc), but I suspect the  ""medicine"" will come with an American-born pope standing up to 's deportation cruelty on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall Bergoglian message. It'll be an interesting decade or so for Catholic politics and drama, no doubt.

there are three main things that i 'm looking at that suggest leo will be similar to the late francis in at least some ways : his twitter account before becoming pope , leo 's career during the francis pontificate , and two key cardinals that are rumored to have leo during the conclave votes . # prevost 's twitter history prior to becoming pope , prevost/leo maintained a twitter account called @ drprevost as a bishop . he did n't tweet anything in 2024 , but in 2025 tweeted five times . two of these tweets were about pope francis ' health , but the other three were of and vance . they were retweets of condemnations of the deportation of kilmar garcia and vance 's use of `` ordo amoris '' to justify caring less about immigrants than citizens . , one of the latter retweets was from national catholic reporter , . or ncr . ncr , as you might guess , focuses on catholic related news , but is n't actually affilated with the catholic church due to being left wing at times . back in the late 60s , they published confidential reports showing that there was a lot of internal to the publishing of humanae vitae ( aka the rcc 's current list of sexual no-no 's that remains the standard to this day ) . so , not only did the new pope the trump-vance deportation agenda , he did so by at least once retweeting an article from a news source that represents the majority of left wing catholics in the us , and one that has been even as `` no true catholic '' by a few bishops in america . you think this might be a one-off where prevost/leo  happens to on one thing with the new administration , but there are even older retweets that suggest otherwise . these include retweeting chris murphy talking about gun control in the wake of the las vegas shooting , reposting over the of george floyd , and even more he 's retweeted the jesuit priest james martin . martin is known within the catholic world for perhaps being the rcc 's most pro-lgbt cleric ( while he 's never outright called for gay marriage , everything else he says is very episcopal sounding ) , to the point where wing catholics view him as a . all of this , combined with the calling out of deportations , suggests someone who , if not a democrat , is by much of the social policy and of the years , in line with francis ' statements during that time period . it 's a difference with evangelicals and many wing catholics that are supporters . while i expect pope leo to be and with and vance , he 'll likely take off the kid gloves when condemning wing populism , francis before him . # prevost 's career rise under francis the prefect of the dicastery of bishops is , by it 's very nature , one of the most positions within the vatican . given how much religious authority a bishop has in his diocese , the person picking the men for such positions is in a prime role to greatly influence the human resources policy and theological leanings of local churches around the world . do n't believe me ? look up both robert mcelroy and raymond burke and compare/contrast them . the former  got moved to the archdiocese of washington dc ( almost certainly for the purpose of being a for the next four years ) , while the former , a benedict appointee , has been shut out of  influence for years but is a among the far online catholic community . i can not imagine pope francis , a man who was very for a catholic prelate and someone who tried to `` pack '' the college of cardinals with men who his vision , would allow a secret to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world . the previous prefect , marc ouellet , was a benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a for delivering francis the papacy in 2013. ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75 , and when he finally retired , i think francis saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked prevost out of peru to carry it out . the two past prefects , giovanni battista re and ouellet , were a curia veteran and archbishop of quebec respectively . both had experience running large church operations in places . leo , by contrast , was running a seemingly random diocese in peru when called up by francis . this suggests to me that francis knew leo 's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be to bishop candidates that would carry out francis ' vision and spread his message around the world . # pierre and cupich two notable cardinals in the francis camp , per the pillar , were arguing for votes to go prevost 's way before the conclave began : christoph pierre and blase cupich . born in france , christoph pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the united states ( aka he 's the vatican 's ambassador to the us ) . before being assigned to dc in 2016 , he was the nuncio to mexico , and at the time the mexican bishop 's conference was considered to be among the most in latam . francis had a go with them in 2016 ( google `` francis rebukes mexican bishops '' for more details ) . pierre closely with francis in `` dealing '' with them , and is generally thought to have done a job as ambassador . after this , francis reassigned him to dc , replacing the far carlo vigano . pierre now had the job of handling the wing usccb and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country . ( i should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they 're stationed in , along with conducting interviews with  that know them , before passing on a shortlist of three names to the dicastery of bishops for their own decision-making . ) francis made the move of giving pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 ( same year as leo ) , and i this was a for francis in both america and mexico . blase cupich 's supposed of leo before the conclave , in my opinion and if true , is the single piece of evidence that suggests to me that leo will be a second francis . cupich is the current archbishop of chicago , but even before that he was showing signs of acting more an episcopalian than a catholic . in spokane , he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of planned parenthood ( although he the overturning of roe in 2022 , any catholic bishop ) and before that , in city , pushed back against the idea of catholic democrats the eucharist if they abortion . ( raymond burke first brought up that idea over john kerry being the democratic nominee for president in 2004 . ) as archbishop of chicago , cupich has gone after the latin mass , gun control efforts , allowed his charity employees to help  register for health insurance under the aca , pushed back against the usccb 's statement on biden in 2020 ( he said it ill-considered - i should mentioned it focused on abortion ) , and most delivered an invocation at the 2024 dnc . given how much abortion rights were a major focus of kamala harris ' campaign , catholics denounced cupich doing this for reasons that do n't need explaining . cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to francis , and supposedly had a say in the appointments of american bishops . for example , according to the pillar he managed to get cardinal mcelroy the dc archdiocese , despite others making for moderate candidates . national catholic reporter also says that he and prevost are close - probably a chicago connection going on there , and i would assume cupich first heard of prevost not long after becoming chicago 's archbishop . if one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the us was backing prevost/leo for the papacy , this had to have been a francis candidate in one form or fashion . i can not imagine cupich backing someone unless he was this candidate would continue most of francis ' agenda and theological focuses . cupich is n't to for a closeted - it would be bush 41 nominating souter for scotus , and as we all know souter turned out to be a liberal judge . as one of francis ' point men , cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be to vote for , and leo obviously made that list . the fact that prevost was supposedly preferred as a `` plan a '' over tagle , a more obvious `` francis '' candidate , suggests that prevost was comforably `` francis-esque '' in cupich 's eyes . # so what kind of pope will leo xiv be ? this is the big question everyone is asking . although leo shares much in common with francis , each pope tries to leave their own mark and blaze their own path . benedict xvi , for example , was in some ways different in style and substance than john paul ii , despite being the latter 's close advisor and a fellow . i leo will be similar - following the broad strokes of the francis papacy , while adding his own and style to it as he wishes . now , i do n't expect leo to be off the bat - he 's on record opposing women deacons , is as anti-abortion as any catholic prelate you can think of , and the onyl  record of him speaking on lgbt is from 2012 , where he for `` homosexual lifestyles '' and from 2016 , where he opposed peruvian schools teaching about `` gender ideology '' . however , it should be mentioned that francis was opposed to argentina 's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 when he was an archbishop , and then became the pope most accomidating of lgbt  in history . perhaps prevost will be the same , over the course of many year of what could be a decade long pontificate or more . in general , my current guess is that leo will be slightly more than francis on gender and lgbt within the church . however , i expect him to go big on other francis was in - immigration , fighting climate change , and social and economic justice . as a peruvian bishop , prevost/leo strongly refugees from venezuela arriving in the country , and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change , having said the church must move `` from words to action '' on the . the leo xiv papacy will likely continue to move the rcc in the general direction that his predecessor began . one other point i 'd make , purely my guesswork and hypotheticals , is that i think leo was voted for by at least a few of the cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the usccb for . in most countries , the `` bergoglian '' wing of the church is in command . the us is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case , probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning roe and wanting to see abortion banned . the differences between the the american rcc and the rcc in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of  realize , and many of francis came from american catholics . francis made some steps to counter them ( promoting cupich and mcelroy to the rank of cardinal , putting prevost in the dicastery of bishops etc ) , but i the  `` medicine '' will come with an american-born pope standing up to 's deportation on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall bergoglian message . it 'll be an decade or so for catholic politics and drama , no . anyhow , let me know what you think of any of this ."

https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/1l808py/economics_is_not_a_science_is_the_worst_economics/,climate change is real,“Economics is not a science” is the worst economics take of all time,"*Against all the empirical results that academia can conjure, all the citations that online economics nerds can produce, the cranks send unto them… [only you](https://x.com/oren_cass/status/1928801739840319520).*

I seriously mean what I’m saying. [Some](https://x.com/djw172/status/1928863126205677593) argue that whether the field is scientific doesn’t matter, but I can’t disagree more; the foundation of almost any view of science is empiricism, so claiming that economics isn’t a science is tantamount to claiming that it has little connection to reality at all. You can only say this with willful ignorance of the work economists do.

But I’ve still tried my best to take arguments that economics is not a science seriously. If you want an extensive argument against this position, you might want to start with [the first part of a series on my blog](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-prelude); this post summarizes the whole series. The first part provides arguments that you should still care about evidence instead of cynically believing everything is a conspiracy. This is followed by [an introduction to econometrics](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-2) presented in connection with whether the field is scientific (essentially a textbook), then [an exploration of the philosophy of science](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-3) and whether economics can be considered scientific in light of the field’s many habits and ideas. I ended with [a concluding piece](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-4) showing that “Economics is not a science” is still misleading and uninformative, even if you grant that it’s true by some definition of the term science.

This post will summarize this series, but I’ve added a lot, too. Much of this is /r/badeconomics content, but this is necessarily a /r/badphilosophy crossover post as well.

Beginning with the interactions linked at the start, you might notice that arguments that economics isn’t a science don’t really engage with the field. [Noah Smith](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-anti-economists-have-overreached) has written about this himself, and still receives [replies that make the same error](https://x.com/AlanLevinovitz/status/1928889802457288858). Consider just one excerpt from the linked essay by Alan Levinovitz:

> Unlike engineers and chemists, economists cannot point to concrete objects – cell phones, plastic – to justify the high valuation of their discipline. Nor, in the case of financial economics and macroeconomics, can they point to the predictive power of their theories. [...] The failure of the field to predict the 2008 crisis has also been well-documented.

This is plain wrong, as shown in Noah’s post. Auction theory, for example, is used by Google to predict how buyers bid for online ads or spectrum rights. I’ve also prepared [a list of fifty (well, technically 2,050) real-world events conforming to the predictions of the standard, competitive model of supply and demand.](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/supply-and-demand-usually-works-a)

Criticizing economists for failing to predict the 2008 crisis is practically a category error, too, like criticizing public health experts for failing to reliably predict earthquakes. [Economic forecasting](https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/why-forecasts-by-elite-economists-are-usually-wrong/) really does tend to be overconfident, but that doesn’t imply the whole field has failed. The primary business of academic economists, if they can even be said to have one, is identifying causal effects of public policies, not predicting macroeconomic indicators like the unemployment rate. I can tell you for a fact that in all of my years of undergrad, we spent precisely zero minutes learning about how to do that. We did spend a lot of time learning about methods like differences-in-differences, one way to try to identify the difference between the real case of a public policy being implemented and an unobservable counterfactual case. Similarly, we mostly turn to doctors for treatments that make us better off than if we hadn’t taken them, not for predictions about our health.

I can only describe the rest of the linked essay as annoying and misleading, about as informative about economics as [Spirit Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw) is about human history. But I want to take a broader look at these problems, beginning with an excerpt from the aforementioned series on my blog. I suspect this kind of mistrust is driving 90% of the nonsense you see perpetuated today, but it’s mostly the business of Donald Trump:

> The world is a mess, rife with elites and their journalists who are happy to lie and mislead, constantly. They are destroying this country from the inside out. If we don’t do something, they will. And they’ll tell you that I’m a liar, a thief, and a cheat—and hell, sometimes they’ll be right!—but know that for everything they say about me, they’ve done worse. They’re just better at covering it up.

The main point of what I wrote is that this kind of thinking can’t really be shown to be wrong, whether in politics, economics, or any other field. A friend might share [a video on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJzalsapWmN/) showing the sea level staying about the same in some unidentified coastal location, and then you might try to respond with [data showing that the global sea level has risen](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level), and by an amount that might not even be discernible with a timelapse like that. Problem solved?

But after some discussion, they might say the data is made up. You might be clever enough to tell them that it’s very hard to pull that off, because other scientists might fail to replicate your measurements (in fact, the measurements are shown to be replicated in the linked graph). Lots of people are involved in gathering data like this, so it’s hard to keep anyone from becoming a leak. Focusing on news stories, I tried to get inventive with an argument that distant reporting is usually accurate because reality is “chained” and the absence of an event would quickly cause reporting on it to be falsified by local sources.

All of these arguments can be applied to economic issues as well, and deployed to defend everything from FRED data on living standards to papers that apply instrumental variables. But these arguments just don’t work, because they provide no guarantee: maybe every scientist really *is* in on a large conspiracy, and they’re just that good at covering it up. Maybe Paul Krugman and Scott Lincicome are both in a secret club that plots to fool you at every turn. It’s powerful stuff—something like Descartes’ evil demon.

This level of skepticism doesn’t lead to true epistemic nihilism, where everything is in doubt, but to *political* epistemic nihilism. If you are sufficiently good at doubting things, you can satisfy your moral and political intuitions with whatever beliefs you’d like. Tariffs can costlessly provide revenue, immigrants can be evil sex pest criminal job-stealers, and rent control can make housing more affordable without unintended consequences. It’s a deep love of selective doubt for anything displeasing, [a kind of celebration of ignorance](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/632474-i-have-a-foreboding-of-an-america-in-my-children-s).

There is no reason to proceed if you think like this and have strong incentives to stick to your guns and believe what you want. Some ideas provide a lot of emotional comfort, and if Oren Cass still gets money from Republicans in 10 years, he will still be [lying about free trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/1jpwaz5/arguing_in_favor_of_tariffs_is_easy_if_nobody/). I don’t have a cure for invulnerability to evidence, but I do have good reason to believe economics is a science if you seriously care about evidence.

One of the sticking points of [the article reposted as a reply to Noah](https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers) was that economists cover up a lack of empiricism with math. I actually care a lot about this problem! It’s hard for people to trust the things economists say and do when fancy econometrics is involved. That’s part of the reason why I tried to make econometrics more accessible through the second part of the series. Compared to the textbooks I read in college, I think I provided more detail about how the math works while only assuming an understanding of basic algebra.

Before getting into that, it’s very important to know that [about 70% of economics papers today are empirical](https://x.com/StefanFSchubert/status/1925892166628348260), assuming NBER and CEPR are representative. They’re major publishers, in any case. In light of that, if you want to criticize the field, what you should be engaging with are methods like instrumental variables and regression discontinuity design. I suspect that critics like Cass and Levinovitz so rarely talk about them because it’s easier to attack other parts of the field and pretend it’s non-empirical. But the days when Levinovitz’s quote of Robert Lucas might be accurate to the whole field are long gone.

I wrote about most of the biggest statistical techniques used in economics papers today; for this post, I’ll focus on just one to make the same point. Regression discontinuity design exploits sudden changes in relationships to find causal effects. RDD studies often use arbitrary, human-designed cutoffs, like [the grade cutoff for receiving a high school diploma](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46443231_The_Signaling_Value_of_a_High_School_Diploma). If the treatment applied to those who meet the cutoff has an effect on an outcome like earnings, the treatment should be the only significant difference between those who barely meet the cutoff and those who barely miss it. We can thus make a comparison between the two to identify the effect of the diploma or other treatment. This strategy is pretty convincing, and it also [doesn’t suffer much from p-hacking and publication bias](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190687), at least in comparison to others. That linked study found that receiving a diploma doesn’t seem to influence earnings much, but [findings vary](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/caje.12489#caje12489-sec-0006); typically, [estimates of the return to education are positive](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09645292.2018.1484426).

It’s worthwhile to appreciate the scientific content this adds to economics. If the assumptions of these methods are right—and they’re often pretty reasonable—they identify causal effects using data from the real world, not arbitrary assumptions and mathematical models. This is a stark contrast with the clouds punched in [the previously-linked essay](https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers). It’s also a much better way to understand the world than speculating based on our intuitions, since it allows us to avoid omitted variable bias, [discussed at the beginning of part 2](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-2).

But we’ve been burying the lede. What really counts as science, anyway? That’s the focus of [part 3](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-3), and it takes us on quite a detour from the field of economics. I’ll condense the philosophy and focus on the field of economics. In short:

* Early 20th-century philosophy of science was dominated by the logical positivists, who believed ideas were only scientific (or meaningful at all) if they satisfied the verifiability criterion of meaning: statements are meaningful if they are empirically verifiable or tautological.
* Karl Popper famously tried to solve both the demarcation problem (what counts as science?) and the problem of induction (how can we know that the future will be like the past?) using falsificationism. This idea says that ideas are scientific if they are falsifiable and have thus far stood up to testing.
* Other views of science that came after Popper focused more on the structure of scientific investigation and the norms that prevail in science. Thomas Kuhn is one of the more famous proponents of the former view, arguing that rather than falsifying one idea after another, sciences rely on paradigms, whole packages of ideas about the world and how to do science, and these shift over time.
* Skipping a lot, the typical philosopher of science today is a scientific realist, meaning they believe we all inhabit a common reality, and an *actual* (it’s what scientists do) and *reasonable* (it’s possible) aim of science is to describe reality.

There are various ideas I presented in the larger post to defend the claim that economics is a science. I’ll simplify them and give each in a paragraph.

Ideas in economics are often strong generalizations, like the law of supply. Popper described how generalizations like this are not cleanly falsifiable but are instead falsifiable in a more probabilistic sense. You can’t falsify the law of supply by pointing to a single case where it seemed not to apply; you need to show it’s generally not true. You might argue that generalizations are not meaningful, but I provided a very formal description in the post that gives them clear meaning. In short, claiming you are very confident something is true or will happen can be taken to mean you are 90% confident in it, and that statements you make with that degree of confidence will happen ~90% of the time after sufficient observations have been made. It’s reasonable to allow for some errors.

Economics does not have laws in the sense we mean when talking about the laws of physics. Laws in physics are clearly not generalizations, but also aren’t just “things that are always true”, like “There are no 10 km tall butter statues of Ayn Rand”. The strict sense of “law” people usually mean is something like a causal relationship that always holds, and as described by John T. Roberts, physics has yet to discover any such laws. Newton’s second law, for example, fails to hold at relativistic speeds. So while economics doesn’t have laws, physics lacks laws as well, and the most significant difference is that only physics can hope to one day find laws. Using speculation about the possibility of laws to dismiss some things as not-science and describe others as science is flimsy and useless, so both should be considered science.

Are economists too ideological and stubborn to be responsive to new evidence? The history of the field provides some cause for optimism. Say’s Law used to be sacred among economists, but was proven incorrect by the Great Depression. The field slowly adjusted and integrated the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. Similarly, Card and Krueger’s study of the minimum wage hike in New Jersey triggered a revision of the literature on the minimum wage, which has generally found [negligible but usually negative effects on employment](https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/lweab/Doucougliagos%20&%20Stanley%20Publication%20Selection%20Bias%20in%20Min%20Wage%20Research-A%20Metaregression%20Analysis.pdf). Stubbornness and wrong ideas are also not disqualifying for a science—physicists believed in an unobservable luminiferous ether for a long time before Michelson and Morley showed it didn’t exist with an experiment, and even that didn’t instantly change everyone’s mind. Einstein stated “I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice” in response to the random outcomes observed in quantum physics. Waiting for even more evidence to emerge and explaining away strange results is just a part of science; the important part is that you eventually give in, at least on most issues.

The field is greatly dependent on linear regression, explained at length in part 2. But these regressions give the appearance of being meaningless, since they try to analyze extremely complex systems by merely relating one variable to another. In part 3, it’s shown that linear regression can, in principle, identify causal effects even when we are ignorant about the complexity of what’s being analyzed. The example used shows that it’s mostly fine to perform a regression of acceleration on force while being ignorant about mass if mass is uncorrelated with force. You are at least able to find the direction of the effect. This is the key assumption of exogeneity, or a lack of omitted variable bias.

The field is also criticized for lacking consensus, but this is very misleading. It’s true in many cases, but the field does have a consensus on a number of important issues. Survey data showing this can be found [here](https://kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/), [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/where-is-there-consensus-among-american-economic-historians-the-results-of-a-survey-on-forty-propositions/A0B369E27B4B1BAFFD29AB83CC53B718), and [here](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18728/w18728.pdf). For example, back in 2012, [zero economists on the Kent Clark Center’s panel](https://kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/laffer-curve/) agreed that cutting income taxes would raise revenue. 71% disagreed, with the rest uncertain, having no opinion, or not answering. Academic economists rarely identify with particular “schools of thought” found in the popular imagination, like the Austrian school, and even these schools agree with the rest of the field on most issues. Some schools of thought, like Marxism, don’t even provide answers to the questions of greatest concern to academic economists. There is no alternative Marxist literature on the empirical minimum wage elasticity with respect to employment.

Potential problems with empirical research like p-hacking don’t make the field look significantly worse than others. In fact, one study found that the reported share of p-values in the 0.01 to 0.05 range was lowest in economics and remarkably high elsewhere. Major empirical methods appear to suffer from some combination of p-hacking and publication bias, with RCT and RDD suffering less than IV and DID. On balance, things don’t look too bad, but regardless, this has been an issue with the sciences in general for some time now.

John Ioannidis provided a quite famous criticism of published research findings that apply to economics as well, as described in Christensen and Miguel (2018). But the scope of his claim, “Most published research findings are false”, is exaggerated. The key assumption of his model, derived from Bayes’ theorem, is a low prior probability that something is true. This prior is clearly low for large, exploratory studies involving thousands of genes, where we suspect only a small number to be related to a disease, as described in his paper. But when we’re talking about relationships in economics, like the law of supply, the value of the prior probability is not obviously low and arguably incoherent.

Edward Leamer’s 1983 paper “Let’s Take the Con out of Econometrics” expressed concern over economists publishing false positives by trying large numbers of specifications for their models, made possible by what were then recent advancements in computational capacity. His suggested solution, transparently reporting all tested specifications, appears to have influenced modern econometric work and how the subject is taught at universities. This is another reason for optimism about the field’s ability to avoid statistical malpractice.

Fraud and reproducibility appear to be two of the weaker points for the field. There doesn’t appear to be any formal procedure for detecting and preventing fraud in economics, though there are private organizations that have done this. One study of the rate of retraction over academic misconduct found the rate to be below average, but above the median, for the social sciences. (I’m aware that we would ideally disaggregate by field and look at the rate in economics, but [you can’t always get what you want](https://youtu.be/ZUqSNbJuGOw?si=2oJ_pytf4LHW5orL).) The rate of replication is [relatively low](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171031). Regardless, the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) is a problem for the sciences as a whole, so this doesn’t seem to be a reason to ignore economists while listening to other experts. Christensen and Miguel (2018) also included a couple of funnel plots that suggest estimated effects tend toward the same real value.

If the weak points of economics are too much for you and your definition of science is too strict to classify it that way, it’s still misleading and harmful to describe economics as unscientific. Economists put a lot of effort into documenting and studying the way the economy works in the real world. If the only work in economics were [this paper](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.4.187) showing import prices suddenly rising when tariffs are implemented, it would still be an informative field. Denouncing it as unscientific only serves to encourage people to ignore important empirical results.

I thought it would be good to take a moment to speculate about why people denounce economics as unscientific. The obvious answer, and I think the right one, is that people are inconvenienced by its findings and have ideological or political motivations that are easier to satisfy without empiricism. I also suspect that they don’t put nearly as much effort into rooting out ideology compared to economists. In any case, I’m only speculating about this, and the focus should always be on the ideas rather than the motivations of different speakers.

I’d like to introduce a challenge. I don’t think you can convincingly do either of these things:

* Establish a definition of science that clearly includes pharmacology but excludes economics.

* Establish that neither economics nor pharmacology are scientific. At the same time, establish that you should listen to doctors and take important medications like the COVID-19 vaccine while ignoring the advice of economists on public policy.

The two fields have oddly similar features in that the things they study are very complex, and estimates of treatment effects vary, making the summarization of existing literature difficult.

For now, I’m still going to have beautiful little microchips in my veins, and I’m still going to believe higher interest rates don’t cause inflation. Anyone who believes the laws of economics are mere social conventions is free to try defying these conventions by doubling their money supply.

Some of the things stated in the Levinovitz article, like “The discipline of economics, however, is presently so blinkered by the talismanic authority of mathematics that theories go overvalued and unchecked”, should be obviously misleading after reading the preceding text. Plenty of work is done to check economic theory; [that’s what the econometrics is for!](https://i.imgflip.com/88c50q.png?a485856) But I think it’s worthwhile to provide more detail about what’s wrong with everything else. The article has [already been R1’d on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4dex3l/economics_is_a_highly_paid_pseudoscience/d1qc1z6/), but I have my own commentary to add.

The plague of mathiness is a reasonable criticism, but not disqualifying for the field. You can simply ignore the difficult papers and focus on the easier ones, some of which are explained in [part 2](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-2) to demonstrate the usage of various econometric techniques. More importantly, economists like Romer and McCloskey—cited in the article as critics of mathiness—would never use ideas like “Economics isn’t a science” as a Trojan horse for idiotic policy choices. But nobody reading or citing articles like this will take the time to ask what these economists think when asked things like “Should the federal minimum wage be $30/hour?” Levinovitz was still happy to link his old article when people were criticizing the cranks, as if it would be taken as serious criticism rather than a mental escape route for idiots.

This might be taken to mean I don’t think there’s room for serious criticism of the field’s scientific norms, or lack thereof. I only mean that any such criticism should try to engage with how the field typically behaves, or otherwise make it clear that the problems it’s describing don’t generalize. Providing work like that in such a context is bad both for the content of the work and the way it’s presented, as a kind of “he’s right, you know.” My own work includes plenty of good reasons to have doubts about some of the work economists do, but I wouldn’t use it in this way.

The obsession with the failure to predict the Great Recession makes the article much weaker as a criticism of the field as a whole. It works great only if the audience is uninformed enough to think the typical economist is some guy in a suit working at Goldman Sachs, looking at graphs of stock prices all day. Across three and a half years of study, I can remember being taught only *one* paper that used stock price data: a DiD study looking at how the stock prices of companies with and without much low-wage labor changed after the sudden announcement of a minimum wage hike. This was also one of the weakest pieces of work I saw, and that was admitted openly. (It only shows that investors think minimum wage hikes hurt prices, which is obvious.)

Reading [the cited essay from Paul Krugman](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html), I can’t help but get the feeling that economists are often giving in to a public demand for expert self-flagellation. An expert saying “the experts are wrong!” is a great way to appeal to Americans’ hatred of the idea that someone might know more than they do, especially about something as important as the economy. They’re happy to benefit from expertise when it carries them in a plane for thousands of miles, fixes their car, or keeps the economy out of a depression, but very upset when it obligates them to schedule an appointment for a vaccine or quit voting for institutionalized woo.

I don’t think we can permanently convince the general public to quit it. This forum and other spaces like it have been trying to put to rest the same nonsense for a long time. But I don’t think we should have any qualms about our prideful superiority until one of these people takes five minutes to scroll through an actual economics paper until they hit the section with regression output.",Skeeh,badeconomics,In-favor,Climate Change,"“Economics is not a science” is the worst economics take of all time *Against all the empirical results that academia can conjure, all the citations that online economics nerds can produce, the cranks send unto them… [only you](https://x.com/oren_cass/status/1928801739840319520).*

I seriously mean what I’m saying. [Some](https://x.com/djw172/status/1928863126205677593) argue that whether the field is scientific doesn’t matter, but I can’t disagree more; the foundation of almost any view of science is empiricism, so claiming that economics isn’t a science is tantamount to claiming that it has little connection to reality at all. You can only say this with willful ignorance of the work economists do.

But I’ve still tried my best to take arguments that economics is not a science seriously. If you want an extensive argument against this position, you might want to start with [the first part of a series on my blog](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-prelude); this post summarizes the whole series. The first part provides arguments that you should still care about evidence instead of cynically believing everything is a conspiracy. This is followed by [an introduction to econometrics](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-2) presented in connection with whether the field is scientific (essentially a textbook), then [an exploration of the philosophy of science](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-3) and whether economics can be considered scientific in light of the field’s many habits and ideas. I ended with [a concluding piece](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-4) showing that “Economics is not a science” is still misleading and uninformative, even if you grant that it’s true by some definition of the term science.

This post will summarize this series, but I’ve added a lot, too. Much of this is /r/badeconomics content, but this is necessarily a /r/badphilosophy crossover post as well.

Beginning with the interactions linked at the start, you might notice that arguments that economics isn’t a science don’t really engage with the field. [Noah Smith](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-anti-economists-have-overreached) has written about this himself, and still receives [replies that make the same error](https://x.com/AlanLevinovitz/status/1928889802457288858). Consider just one excerpt from the linked essay by Alan Levinovitz:

> Unlike engineers and chemists, economists cannot point to concrete objects – cell phones, plastic – to justify the high valuation of their discipline. Nor, in the case of financial economics and macroeconomics, can they point to the predictive power of their theories. [...] The failure of the field to predict the 2008 crisis has also been well-documented.

This is plain wrong, as shown in Noah’s post. Auction theory, for example, is used by Google to predict how buyers bid for online ads or spectrum rights. I’ve also prepared [a list of fifty (well, technically 2,050) real-world events conforming to the predictions of the standard, competitive model of supply and demand.](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/supply-and-demand-usually-works-a)

Criticizing economists for failing to predict the 2008 crisis is practically a category error, too, like criticizing public health experts for failing to reliably predict earthquakes. [Economic forecasting](https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/why-forecasts-by-elite-economists-are-usually-wrong/) really does tend to be overconfident, but that doesn’t imply the whole field has failed. The primary business of academic economists, if they can even be said to have one, is identifying causal effects of public policies, not predicting macroeconomic indicators like the unemployment rate. I can tell you for a fact that in all of my years of undergrad, we spent precisely zero minutes learning about how to do that. We did spend a lot of time learning about methods like differences-in-differences, one way to try to identify the difference between the real case of a public policy being implemented and an unobservable counterfactual case. Similarly, we mostly turn to doctors for treatments that make us better off than if we hadn’t taken them, not for predictions about our health.

I can only describe the rest of the linked essay as annoying and misleading, about as informative about economics as [Spirit Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw) is about human history. But I want to take a broader look at these problems, beginning with an excerpt from the aforementioned series on my blog. I suspect this kind of mistrust is driving 90% of the nonsense you see perpetuated today, but it’s mostly the business of Donald Trump:

> The world is a mess, rife with elites and their journalists who are happy to lie and mislead, constantly. They are destroying this country from the inside out. If we don’t do something, they will. And they’ll tell you that I’m a liar, a thief, and a cheat—and hell, sometimes they’ll be right!—but know that for everything they say about me, they’ve done worse. They’re just better at covering it up.

The main point of what I wrote is that this kind of thinking can’t really be shown to be wrong, whether in politics, economics, or any other field. A friend might share [a video on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJzalsapWmN/) showing the sea level staying about the same in some unidentified coastal location, and then you might try to respond with [data showing that the global sea level has risen](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level), and by an amount that might not even be discernible with a timelapse like that. Problem solved?

But after some discussion, they might say the data is made up. You might be clever enough to tell them that it’s very hard to pull that off, because other scientists might fail to replicate your measurements (in fact, the measurements are shown to be replicated in the linked graph). Lots of people are involved in gathering data like this, so it’s hard to keep anyone from becoming a leak. Focusing on news stories, I tried to get inventive with an argument that distant reporting is usually accurate because reality is “chained” and the absence of an event would quickly cause reporting on it to be falsified by local sources.

All of these arguments can be applied to economic issues as well, and deployed to defend everything from FRED data on living standards to papers that apply instrumental variables. But these arguments just don’t work, because they provide no guarantee: maybe every scientist really *is* in on a large conspiracy, and they’re just that good at covering it up. Maybe Paul Krugman and Scott Lincicome are both in a secret club that plots to fool you at every turn. It’s powerful stuff—something like Descartes’ evil demon.

This level of skepticism doesn’t lead to true epistemic nihilism, where everything is in doubt, but to *political* epistemic nihilism. If you are sufficiently good at doubting things, you can satisfy your moral and political intuitions with whatever beliefs you’d like. Tariffs can costlessly provide revenue, immigrants can be evil sex pest criminal job-stealers, and rent control can make housing more affordable without unintended consequences. It’s a deep love of selective doubt for anything displeasing, [a kind of celebration of ignorance](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/632474-i-have-a-foreboding-of-an-america-in-my-children-s).

There is no reason to proceed if you think like this and have strong incentives to stick to your guns and believe what you want. Some ideas provide a lot of emotional comfort, and if Oren Cass still gets money from Republicans in 10 years, he will still be [lying about free trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/1jpwaz5/arguing_in_favor_of_tariffs_is_easy_if_nobody/). I don’t have a cure for invulnerability to evidence, but I do have good reason to believe economics is a science if you seriously care about evidence.

One of the sticking points of [the article reposted as a reply to Noah](https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers) was that economists cover up a lack of empiricism with math. I actually care a lot about this problem! It’s hard for people to trust the things economists say and do when fancy econometrics is involved. That’s part of the reason why I tried to make econometrics more accessible through the second part of the series. Compared to the textbooks I read in college, I think I provided more detail about how the math works while only assuming an understanding of basic algebra.

Before getting into that, it’s very important to know that [about 70% of economics papers today are empirical](https://x.com/StefanFSchubert/status/1925892166628348260), assuming NBER and CEPR are representative. They’re major publishers, in any case. In light of that, if you want to criticize the field, what you should be engaging with are methods like instrumental variables and regression discontinuity design. I suspect that critics like Cass and Levinovitz so rarely talk about them because it’s easier to attack other parts of the field and pretend it’s non-empirical. But the days when Levinovitz’s quote of Robert Lucas might be accurate to the whole field are long gone.

I wrote about most of the biggest statistical techniques used in economics papers today; for this post, I’ll focus on just one to make the same point. Regression discontinuity design exploits sudden changes in relationships to find causal effects. RDD studies often use arbitrary, human-designed cutoffs, like [the grade cutoff for receiving a high school diploma](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46443231_The_Signaling_Value_of_a_High_School_Diploma). If the treatment applied to those who meet the cutoff has an effect on an outcome like earnings, the treatment should be the only significant difference between those who barely meet the cutoff and those who barely miss it. We can thus make a comparison between the two to identify the effect of the diploma or other treatment. This strategy is pretty convincing, and it also [doesn’t suffer much from p-hacking and publication bias](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190687), at least in comparison to others. That linked study found that receiving a diploma doesn’t seem to influence earnings much, but [findings vary](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/caje.12489#caje12489-sec-0006); typically, [estimates of the return to education are positive](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09645292.2018.1484426).

It’s worthwhile to appreciate the scientific content this adds to economics. If the assumptions of these methods are right—and they’re often pretty reasonable—they identify causal effects using data from the real world, not arbitrary assumptions and mathematical models. This is a stark contrast with the clouds punched in [the previously-linked essay](https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers). It’s also a much better way to understand the world than speculating based on our intuitions, since it allows us to avoid omitted variable bias, [discussed at the beginning of part 2](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-2).

But we’ve been burying the lede. What really counts as science, anyway? That’s the focus of [part 3](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-3), and it takes us on quite a detour from the field of economics. I’ll condense the philosophy and focus on the field of economics. In short:

* Early 20th-century philosophy of science was dominated by the logical positivists, who believed ideas were only scientific (or meaningful at all) if they satisfied the verifiability criterion of meaning: statements are meaningful if they are empirically verifiable or tautological.
* Karl Popper famously tried to solve both the demarcation problem (what counts as science?) and the problem of induction (how can we know that the future will be like the past?) using falsificationism. This idea says that ideas are scientific if they are falsifiable and have thus far stood up to testing.
* Other views of science that came after Popper focused more on the structure of scientific investigation and the norms that prevail in science. Thomas Kuhn is one of the more famous proponents of the former view, arguing that rather than falsifying one idea after another, sciences rely on paradigms, whole packages of ideas about the world and how to do science, and these shift over time.
* Skipping a lot, the typical philosopher of science today is a scientific realist, meaning they believe we all inhabit a common reality, and an *actual* (it’s what scientists do) and *reasonable* (it’s possible) aim of science is to describe reality.

There are various ideas I presented in the larger post to defend the claim that economics is a science. I’ll simplify them and give each in a paragraph.

Ideas in economics are often strong generalizations, like the law of supply. Popper described how generalizations like this are not cleanly falsifiable but are instead falsifiable in a more probabilistic sense. You can’t falsify the law of supply by pointing to a single case where it seemed not to apply; you need to show it’s generally not true. You might argue that generalizations are not meaningful, but I provided a very formal description in the post that gives them clear meaning. In short, claiming you are very confident something is true or will happen can be taken to mean you are 90% confident in it, and that statements you make with that degree of confidence will happen ~90% of the time after sufficient observations have been made. It’s reasonable to allow for some errors.

Economics does not have laws in the sense we mean when talking about the laws of physics. Laws in physics are clearly not generalizations, but also aren’t just “things that are always true”, like “There are no 10 km tall butter statues of Ayn Rand”. The strict sense of “law” people usually mean is something like a causal relationship that always holds, and as described by John T. Roberts, physics has yet to discover any such laws. Newton’s second law, for example, fails to hold at relativistic speeds. So while economics doesn’t have laws, physics lacks laws as well, and the most significant difference is that only physics can hope to one day find laws. Using speculation about the possibility of laws to dismiss some things as not-science and describe others as science is flimsy and useless, so both should be considered science.

Are economists too ideological and stubborn to be responsive to new evidence? The history of the field provides some cause for optimism. Say’s Law used to be sacred among economists, but was proven incorrect by the Great Depression. The field slowly adjusted and integrated the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. Similarly, Card and Krueger’s study of the minimum wage hike in New Jersey triggered a revision of the literature on the minimum wage, which has generally found [negligible but usually negative effects on employment](https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/lweab/Doucougliagos%20&%20Stanley%20Publication%20Selection%20Bias%20in%20Min%20Wage%20Research-A%20Metaregression%20Analysis.pdf). Stubbornness and wrong ideas are also not disqualifying for a science—physicists believed in an unobservable luminiferous ether for a long time before Michelson and Morley showed it didn’t exist with an experiment, and even that didn’t instantly change everyone’s mind. Einstein stated “I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice” in response to the random outcomes observed in quantum physics. Waiting for even more evidence to emerge and explaining away strange results is just a part of science; the important part is that you eventually give in, at least on most issues.

The field is greatly dependent on linear regression, explained at length in part 2. But these regressions give the appearance of being meaningless, since they try to analyze extremely complex systems by merely relating one variable to another. In part 3, it’s shown that linear regression can, in principle, identify causal effects even when we are ignorant about the complexity of what’s being analyzed. The example used shows that it’s mostly fine to perform a regression of acceleration on force while being ignorant about mass if mass is uncorrelated with force. You are at least able to find the direction of the effect. This is the key assumption of exogeneity, or a lack of omitted variable bias.

The field is also criticized for lacking consensus, but this is very misleading. It’s true in many cases, but the field does have a consensus on a number of important issues. Survey data showing this can be found [here](https://kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/), [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/where-is-there-consensus-among-american-economic-historians-the-results-of-a-survey-on-forty-propositions/A0B369E27B4B1BAFFD29AB83CC53B718), and [here](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18728/w18728.pdf). For example, back in 2012, [zero economists on the Kent Clark Center’s panel](https://kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/laffer-curve/) agreed that cutting income taxes would raise revenue. 71% disagreed, with the rest uncertain, having no opinion, or not answering.

In fact, one study found that the reported share of p-values in the 0.01 to 0.05 range was lowest in economics and remarkably high elsewhere. Major empirical methods appear to suffer from some combination of p-hacking and publication bias, with RCT and RDD suffering less than IV and DID. On balance, things don’t look too bad, but regardless, this has been an issue with the sciences in general for some time now.

His suggested solution, transparently reporting all tested specifications, appears to have influenced modern econometric work and how the subject is taught at universities. This is another reason for optimism about the field’s ability to avoid statistical malpractice.

Fraud and reproducibility appear to be two of the weaker points for the field.

Christensen and Miguel (2018) also included a couple of funnel plots that suggest estimated effects tend toward the same real value.

If the weak points of economics are too much for you and your definition of science is too strict to classify it that way, it’s still misleading and harmful to describe economics as unscientific. Economists put a lot of effort into documenting and studying the way the economy works in the real world. If the only work in economics were [this paper](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.4.187) showing import prices suddenly rising when tariffs are implemented, it would still be an informative field. Denouncing it as unscientific only serves to encourage people to ignore important empirical results.

I thought it would be good to take a moment to speculate about why people denounce economics as unscientific. The obvious answer, and I think the right one, is that people are inconvenienced by its findings and have ideological or political motivations that are easier to satisfy without empiricism. I also suspect that they don’t put nearly as much effort into rooting out ideology compared to economists. In any case, I’m only speculating about this, and the focus should always be on the ideas rather than the motivations of different speakers.

I’d like to introduce a challenge. I don’t think you can convincingly do either of these things:

* Establish a definition of science that clearly includes pharmacology but excludes economics.

* Establish that neither economics nor pharmacology are scientific. At the same time, establish that you should listen to doctors and take important medications like the COVID-19 vaccine while ignoring the advice of economists on public policy.

The two fields have oddly similar features in that the things they study are very complex, and estimates of treatment effects vary, making the summarization of existing literature difficult.

For now, I’m still going to have beautiful little microchips in my veins, and I’m still going to believe higher interest rates don’t cause inflation. Anyone who believes the laws of economics are mere social conventions is free to try defying these conventions by doubling their money supply.

Some of the things stated in the Levinovitz article, like “The discipline of economics, however, is presently so blinkered by the talismanic authority of mathematics that theories go overvalued and unchecked”, should be obviously misleading after reading the preceding text. Plenty of work is done to check economic theory; [that’s what the econometrics is for!](https://i.imgflip.com/88c50q.png?a485856) But I think it’s worthwhile to provide more detail about what’s wrong with everything else. The article has [already been R1’d on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4dex3l/economics_is_a_highly_paid_pseudoscience/d1qc1z6/), but I have my own commentary to add.

The plague of mathiness is a reasonable criticism, but not disqualifying for the field. You can simply ignore the difficult papers and focus on the easier ones, some of which are explained in [part 2](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a-science-part-2) to demonstrate the usage of various econometric techniques. More importantly, economists like Romer and McCloskey—cited in the article as critics of mathiness—would never use ideas like “Economics isn’t a science” as a Trojan horse for idiotic policy choices. But nobody reading or citing articles like this will take the time to ask what these economists think when asked things like “Should the federal minimum wage be $30/hour?” Levinovitz was still happy to link his old article when people were criticizing the cranks, as if it would be taken as serious criticism rather than a mental escape route for idiots.

This might be taken to mean I don’t think there’s room for serious criticism of the field’s scientific norms, or lack thereof. I only mean that any such criticism should try to engage with how the field typically behaves, or otherwise make it clear that the problems it’s describing don’t generalize. Providing work like that in such a context is bad both for the content of the work and the way it’s presented, as a kind of “he’s right, you know.” My own work includes plenty of good reasons to have doubts about some of the work economists do, but I wouldn’t use it in this way.

The obsession with the failure to predict the Great Recession makes the article much weaker as a criticism of the field as a whole. It works great only if the audience is uninformed enough to think the typical economist is some guy in a suit working at Goldman Sachs, looking at graphs of stock prices all day. Across three and a half years of study, I can remember being taught only *one* paper that used stock price data: a DiD study looking at how the stock prices of companies with and without much low-wage labor changed after the sudden announcement of a minimum wage hike. This was also one of the weakest pieces of work I saw, and that was admitted openly. (It only shows that investors think minimum wage hikes hurt prices, which is obvious.)

Reading [the cited essay from Paul Krugman](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html), I can’t help but get the feeling that economists are often giving in to a public demand for expert self-flagellation. An expert saying “the experts are wrong!” is a great way to appeal to Americans’ hatred of the idea that someone might know more than they do, especially about something as important as the economy. They’re happy to benefit from expertise when it carries them in a plane for thousands of miles, fixes their car, or keeps the economy out of a depression, but very upset when it obligates them to schedule an appointment for a vaccine or quit voting for institutionalized woo.

I don’t think we can permanently convince the general public to quit it. This forum and other spaces like it have been trying to put to rest the same nonsense for a long time. But I don’t think we should have any qualms about our prideful superiority until one of these people takes five minutes to scroll through an actual economics paper until they hit the section with regression output.","“ economics is not a science ” is the economics take of all time * against all the empirical results that academia can conjure , all the citations that online economics nerds can produce , the cranks send unto them… [ only you ] ( https : //x.com/oren_cass/status/1928801739840319520 ) . * i seriously mean what i ’ m saying .

) and the of induction ( how can we know that the future will be the past ? ) using falsificationism . this idea says that ideas are scientific if they are falsifiable and have thus far stood up to testing . * other views of science that came after popper focused more on the structure of scientific investigation and the norms that prevail in science . thomas kuhn is one of the more proponents of the former view , arguing that rather than falsifying one idea after another , sciences rely on paradigms , whole packages of ideas about the world and how to do science , and these shift over time . * skipping a lot , the typical philosopher of science today is a scientific realist , meaning they believe we all inhabit a common reality , and an * actual * ( it ’ s what scientists do ) and * * ( it ’ s possible ) aim of science is to describe reality . there are various ideas i presented in the larger post to defend the claim that economics is a science . i ’ ll them and give each in a paragraph . ideas in economics are often generalizations , the law of supply . popper described how generalizations this are not falsifiable but are instead falsifiable in a more probabilistic sense . you can ’ t the law of supply by pointing to a single case where it seemed not to apply ; you need to show it ’ s generally not true . you might argue that generalizations are not , but i provided a very formal description in the post that gives them meaning . in short , claiming you are very something is true or will happen can be taken to mean you are 90 % in it , and that statements you make with that degree of will happen ~90 % of the time after observations have been made . it ’ s to allow for some . economics does not have laws in the sense we mean when talking about the laws of physics . laws in physics are not generalizations , but also aren ’ t just “ things that are always true ” , “ there are no 10 km tall butter statues of ayn rand ” . the sense of “ law ” people usually mean is something a causal relationship that always holds , and as described by john t. roberts , physics has yet to discover any such laws . newton ’ s second law , for example , to hold at relativistic speeds . so while economics doesn ’ t have laws , physics laws as , and the most difference is that only physics can hope to one day find laws . using speculation about the possibility of laws to dismiss some things as not-science and describe others as science is and , so both should be considered science . are economists too ideological and to be to new evidence ? the history of the field provides some cause for . say ’ s law used to be sacred among economists , but was by the . the field adjusted and the ideas of john maynard keynes . similarly , card and krueger ’ s study of the minimum wage hike in new jersey triggered a revision of the literature on the minimum wage , which has generally found [ negligible but usually effects on employment ] ( https : //www.ctdol.state.ct.us/lweab/doucougliagos % 20 & % 20stanley % 20publication % 20selection % 20bias % 20in % 20min % 20wage % 20research-a % 20metaregression % 20analysis.pdf ) . and ideas are also not disqualifying for a science—physicists believed in an unobservable luminiferous ether for a long time before michelson and morley showed it didn ’ t exist with an experiment , and even that didn ’ t change everyone ’ s mind . einstein stated “ i am at all events convinced that he does not play dice ” in response to the random outcomes observed in quantum physics . waiting for even more evidence to emerge and explaining away results is just a part of science ; the part is that you eventually give in , at least on most . the field is greatly dependent on linear , explained at length in part 2. but these regressions give the appearance of being , since they try to analyze extremely systems by merely relating one variable to another . in part 3 , it ’ s shown that linear can , in principle , identify causal effects even when we are about the complexity of what ’ s being analyzed . the example used shows that it ’ s mostly to perform a of acceleration on force while being about mass if mass is uncorrelated with force . you are at least able to find the direction of the effect . this is the key assumption of exogeneity , or a of omitted variable . the field is also for consensus , but this is very . it ’ s true in many cases , but the field does have a consensus on a number of . survey data showing this can be found [ here ] ( https : //kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/ ) , [ here ] ( https : //www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/where-is-there-consensus-among-american-economic-historians-the-results-of-a-survey-on-forty-propositions/a0b369e27b4b1baffd29ab83cc53b718 ) , and [ here ] ( https : //www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18728/w18728.pdf ) . for example , back in 2012 , [ zero economists on the kent clark center ’ s panel ] ( https : //kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/laffer-curve/ ) agreed that cutting income taxes would raise revenue . 71 % , with the rest , having no opinion , or not answering . academic economists rarely identify with particular “ schools of thought ” found in the imagination , the austrian school , and even these schools agree with the rest of the field on most . some schools of thought , marxism , don ’ t even provide answers to the questions of to academic economists . there is no alternative marxist literature on the empirical minimum wage elasticity with to employment . potential with empirical research p-hacking don ’ t make the field look significantly than others . in fact , one study found that the reported share of p-values in the 0.01 to 0.05 range was lowest in economics and high elsewhere . major empirical methods appear to from some combination of p-hacking and publication , with rct and rdd less than iv and did . on balance , things don ’ t look too , but regardless , this has been an with the sciences in general for some time now . john ioannidis provided a quite of published research findings that apply to economics as , as described in christensen and miguel ( 2018 ) . but the scope of his claim , “ most published research findings are ” , is exaggerated . the key assumption of his model , derived from bayes ’ theorem , is a low prior probability that something is true . this prior is low for large , exploratory studies involving thousands of genes , where we only a small number to be related to a disease , as described in his paper . but when we ’ re talking about relationships in economics , the law of supply , the value of the prior probability is not obviously low and arguably . edward leamer ’ s 1983 paper “ let ’ s take the con out of econometrics ” expressed over economists publishing by trying large numbers of specifications for their models , made possible by what were then recent advancements in computational capacity . his suggested solution , transparently reporting all tested specifications , appears to have influenced econometric and how the subject is taught at universities . this is another reason for about the field ’ s ability to avoid statistical malpractice . and reproducibility appear to be two of the points for the field . there doesn ’ t appear to be any formal procedure for detecting and preventing in economics , though there are private organizations that have done this . one study of the rate of retraction over academic misconduct found the rate to be below average , but above the median , for the social sciences .

I seriously mean what I’m saying.

You can only say this with willful ignorance of the work economists do.

But I’ve still tried my best to take arguments that economics is not a  seriously. If you want an extensive argument against this position, you might want to start with [the first part of a series on my blog](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a--prelude); this post summarizes the whole series. The first part provides arguments that you should still care about evidence instead of cynically believing everything is a conspiracy.

This post will summarize this series, but I’ve added a lot, too. Much of this is /r/badeconomics content, but this is necessarily a /r/badphilosophy crossover post as well.

Beginning with the interactions linked at the start, you might notice that arguments that economics isn’t a  ’t really engage with the field. [Noah Smith](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-anti-economists-have-overreached) has written about this himself, and still receives [replies that make the same error](https://x.com/AlanLevinovitz/status/1928889802457288858). Consider  one excerpt from the linked essay by Alan Levinovitz:

> Unlike engineers and chemists, economists cannot point to concrete objects – cell phones, plastic – to justify the high valuation of their discipline. Nor, in the case of financial economics and macroeconomics, can they point to the predictive power of their theories. [...] The failure of the field to predict the 2008 crisis has also been well-documented.

This is plain wrong, as shown in Noah’s post. Auction theory, for example, is used by Google to predict how buyers bid for online ads or spectrum rights. I’ve also prepared [a list of fifty (well, technically 2,050) -world events conforming to the predictions of the standard, competitive model of supply and demand.](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/supply-and-demand-usually-works-a)

Criticizing economists for failing to predict the 2008 crisis is practically a category error, too, like criticizing public health experts for failing to reliably predict earthquakes. [Economic forecasting](https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/why-forecasts-by-elite-economists-are-usually-wrong/) really does tend to be overconfident, but that doesn’t imply the whole field has failed. The primary business of academic economists, if they can even be said to have one, is identifying causal effects of public policies, not predicting macroeconomic indicators like the unemployment rate. I can tell you for a fact that in all of my years of undergrad, we spent precisely zero minutes learning about how to do that. We did spend a lot of time learning about methods like differences-in-differences, one way to try to identify the difference between the  case of a public policy being implemented and an unobservable counterfactual case. Similarly, we mostly turn to doctors for treatments that make us better off than if we hadn’t taken them, not for predictions about our health.

I can only describe the rest of the linked essay as annoying and misleading, about as informative about economics as [Spirit ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw) is about human history. But I want to take a broader look at these problems, beginning with an excerpt from the aforementioned series on my blog. I suspect this kind of mistrust is driving 90% of the nonsense you see perpetuated today, but it’s mostly the business of Donald :

> The world is a mess, rife with elites and their journalists who are happy to lie and mislead, constantly. They are destroying this country from the inside out. If we ’t do something, they will. And they’ll tell you that I’m a liar, a thief, and a cheat—and hell, sometimes they’ll be !—but know that for everything they say about me, they’ve done worse. They’re  better at covering it up.

The main point of what I wrote is that this kind of thinking can’t really be shown to be wrong, whether in politics, economics, or any other field. A friend might share [a video on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJzalsapWmN/) showing the sea level staying about the same in some unidentified coastal location, and then you might try to respond with [data showing that the global sea level has risen](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level), and by an amount that might not even be discernible with a timelapse like that. Problem solved?

But after some discussion, they might say the data is made up. You might be clever enough to tell them that it’s very hard to pull that off, because other scientists might fail to replicate your measurements (in fact, the measurements are shown to be replicated in the linked graph). Lots of  are involved in gathering data like this, so it’s hard to keep anyone from becoming a leak. Focusing on news stories, I tried to get inventive with an argument that distant reporting is usually accurate because reality is “chained” and the absence of an event would quickly cause reporting on it to be falsified by local sources.

All of these arguments can be applied to economic issues as well, and deployed to defend everything from FRED data on living standards to papers that apply instrumental variables. But these arguments  ’t work, because they provide no guarantee: maybe every scientist really *is* in on a large conspiracy, and they’re  that good at covering it up. Maybe Paul Krugman and Scott Lincicome are both in a secret club that plots to fool you at every turn. It’s powerful stuff—something like Descartes’ evil demon.

This level of skepticism doesn’t lead to true epistemic nihilism, where everything is in doubt, but to *political* epistemic nihilism. If you are sufficiently good at doubting things, you can satisfy your moral and political intuitions with whatever beliefs you’d like. Tariffs can costlessly provide revenue, immigrants can be evil sex pest criminal job-stealers, and rent control can make housing more affordable without unintended consequences. It’s a deep love of selective doubt for anything displeasing, [a kind of celebration of ignorance](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/632474-i-have-a-foreboding-of-an-america-in-my-children-s).

There is no reason to proceed if you think like this and have strong incentives to stick to your guns and believe what you want. Some ideas provide a lot of emotional comfort, and if Oren Cass still gets  from Republicans in 10 years, he will still be [lying about free trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics//1jpwaz5/arguing_in_favor_of_tariffs_is_easy_if_nobody/). I ’t have a cure for invulnerability to evidence, but I do have good reason to believe economics is a  if you seriously care about evidence.

One of the sticking points of [the article reposted as a reply to Noah](https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers) was that economists cover up a lack of empiricism with math. I actually care a lot about this problem! It’s hard for  to trust the things economists say and do when fancy econometrics is involved. That’s part of the reason why I tried to make econometrics more accessible through the second part of the series. Compared to the textbooks I read in college, I think I provided more detail about how the math works while only assuming an understanding of basic algebra.

Before getting into that, it’s very important to know that [about 70% of economics papers today are empirical](https://x.com/StefanFSchubert/status/1925892166628348260), assuming NBER and CEPR are representative. They’re major publishers, in any case. In light of that, if you want to criticize the field, what you should be engaging with are methods like instrumental variables and regression discontinuity design. I suspect that critics like Cass and Levinovitz so rarely talk about them because it’s easier to attack other parts of the field and pretend it’s non-empirical. But the days when Levinovitz’s quote of Robert Lucas might be accurate to the whole field are long gone.

I wrote about most of the biggest statistical techniques used in economics papers today; for this post, I’ll focus on  one to make the same point. Regression discontinuity design exploits sudden changes in relationships to find causal effects. RDD studies often use arbitrary, human-designed cutoffs, like [the grade cutoff for receiving a high school diploma](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46443231_The_Signaling_Value_of_a_High_School_Diploma). If the treatment applied to those who meet the cutoff has an effect on an outcome like earnings, the treatment should be the only significant difference between those who barely meet the cutoff and those who barely miss it. We can thus make a comparison between the two to identify the effect of the diploma or other treatment. This strategy is pretty convincing, and it also [doesn’t suffer much from p-hacking and publication bias](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190687), at least in comparison to others. That linked study found that receiving a diploma doesn’t seem to influence earnings much, but [findings vary](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/caje.12489#caje12489-sec-0006); typically, [estimates of the return to education are positive](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09645292.2018.1484426).

It’s worthwhile to appreciate the scientific content this adds to economics. If the assumptions of these methods are —and they’re often pretty reasonable—they identify causal effects using data from the  world, not arbitrary assumptions and mathematical models. This is a stark contrast with the clouds punched in [the previously-linked essay](https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers). It’s also a much better way to understand the world than speculating based on our intuitions, since it allows us to avoid omitted variable bias, [discussed at the beginning of part 2](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a--part-2).

But we’ve been burying the lede. What really counts as , anyway? That’s the focus of [part 3](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a--part-3), and it takes us on quite a detour from the field of economics. I’ll condense the philosophy and focus on the field of economics. In short:

* Early 20th-century philosophy of  was dominated by the logical positivists, who believed ideas were only scientific (or meaningful at all) if they satisfied the verifiability criterion of meaning: statements are meaningful if they are empirically verifiable or tautological.
* Karl Popper famously tried to solve both the demarcation problem (what counts as ?) and the problem of induction (how can we know that the future will be like the past?) using falsificationism. This idea says that ideas are scientific if they are falsifiable and have thus far stood up to testing.
* Other views of  that came after Popper focused more on the structure of scientific investigation and the norms that prevail in . Thomas Kuhn is one of the more famous proponents of the former view, arguing that rather than falsifying one idea after another, sciences rely on paradigms, whole packages of ideas about the world and how to do , and these shift over time.
* Skipping a lot, the typical philosopher of  today is a scientific realist, meaning they believe we all inhabit a common reality, and an *actual* (it’s what scientists do) and *reasonable* (it’s possible) aim of  is to describe reality.

There are various ideas I presented in the larger post to defend the claim that economics is a . I’ll simplify them and give each in a paragraph.

Ideas in economics are often strong generalizations, like the law of supply. Popper described how generalizations like this are not cleanly falsifiable but are instead falsifiable in a more probabilistic sense. You can’t falsify the law of supply by pointing to a single case where it seemed not to apply; you need to show it’s generally not true. You might argue that generalizations are not meaningful, but I provided a very formal description in the post that gives them clear meaning. In short, claiming you are very confident something is true or will happen can be taken to mean you are 90% confident in it, and that statements you make with that degree of confidence will happen ~90% of the time after sufficient observations have been made. It’s reasonable to allow for some errors.

Economics does not have laws in the sense we mean when talking about the laws of physics. Laws in physics are clearly not generalizations, but also aren’t  “things that are always true”, like “There are no 10 km tall butter statues of Ayn Rand”. The strict sense of “law”  usually mean is something like a causal relationship that always holds, and as described by John T. Roberts, physics has yet to discover any such laws. Newton’s second law, for example, fails to hold at relativistic speeds. So while economics doesn’t have laws, physics lacks laws as well, and the most significant difference is that only physics can hope to one day find laws. Using speculation about the possibility of laws to dismiss some things as not- and describe others as  is flimsy and useless, so both should be considered .

Are economists too ideological and stubborn to be responsive to new evidence? The history of the field provides some cause for optimism. Say’s Law used to be sacred among economists, but was proven incorrect by the Great Depression. The field slowly adjusted and integrated the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. Similarly, Card and Krueger’s study of the minimum wage hike in New Jersey triggered a revision of the literature on the minimum wage, which has generally found [negligible but usually negative effects on employment](https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/lweab/Doucougliagos%20&%20Stanley%20Publication%20Selection%20Bias%20in%20Min%20Wage%20Research-A%20Metaregression%20Analysis.pdf). Stubbornness and wrong ideas are also not disqualifying for a —physicists believed in an unobservable luminiferous ether for a long time before Michelson and Morley showed it didn’t exist with an experiment, and even that didn’t instantly change everyone’s mind. Einstein stated “I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice” in response to the random outcomes observed in quantum physics. Waiting for even more evidence to emerge and explaining away strange results is  a part of ; the important part is that you eventually give in, at least on most issues.

The field is greatly dependent on linear regression, explained at length in part 2. But these regressions give the appearance of being meaningless, since they try to analyze extremely complex systems by merely relating one variable to another. In part 3, it’s shown that linear regression can, in principle, identify causal effects even when we are ignorant about the complexity of what’s being analyzed. The example used shows that it’s mostly fine to perform a regression of acceleration on force while being ignorant about mass if mass is uncorrelated with force. You are at least able to find the direction of the effect. This is the key assumption of exogeneity, or a lack of omitted variable bias.

The field is also criticized for lacking consensus, but this is very misleading. It’s true in many cases, but the field does have a consensus on a number of important issues. Survey data showing this can be found [here](https://kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/), [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/where-is-there-consensus-among-american-economic-historians-the-results-of-a-survey-on-forty-propositions/A0B369E27B4B1BAFFD29AB83CC53B718), and [here](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18728/w18728.pdf). For example, back in 2012, [zero economists on the Kent Clark Center’s panel](https://kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/laffer-curve/) agreed that cutting income taxes would raise revenue. 71% disagreed, with the rest uncertain, having no opinion, or not answering. Academic economists rarely identify with particular “schools of thought” found in the popular imagination, like the Austrian school, and even these schools agree with the rest of the field on most issues. Some schools of thought, like Marxism, ’t even provide answers to the questions of greatest concern to academic economists. There is no alternative Marxist literature on the empirical minimum wage elasticity with respect to employment.

Potential problems with empirical research like p-hacking ’t make the field look significantly worse than others. In fact, one study found that the reported share of p-values in the 0.01 to 0.05 range was lowest in economics and remarkably high elsewhere. Major empirical methods appear to suffer from some combination of p-hacking and publication bias, with RCT and RDD suffering less than IV and DID. On balance, things ’t look too bad, but regardless, this has been an issue with the sciences in general for some time now.

John Ioannidis provided a quite famous criticism of published research findings that apply to economics as well, as described in Christensen and Miguel (2018). But the scope of his claim, “Most published research findings are false”, is exaggerated. The key assumption of his model, derived from Bayes’ theorem, is a low prior probability that something is true. This prior is clearly low for large, exploratory studies involving thousands of genes, where we suspect only a small number to be related to a disease, as described in his paper. But when we’re talking about relationships in economics, like the law of supply, the value of the prior probability is not obviously low and arguably incoherent.

Edward Leamer’s 1983 paper “Let’s Take the Con out of Econometrics” expressed concern over economists publishing false positives by trying large numbers of specifications for their models, made possible by what were then recent advancements in computational capacity. His suggested solution, transparently reporting all tested specifications, appears to have influenced modern econometric work and how the subject is taught at universities. This is another reason for optimism about the field’s ability to avoid statistical malpractice.

Fraud and reproducibility appear to be two of the weaker points for the field. There doesn’t appear to be any formal procedure for detecting and preventing fraud in economics, though there are private organizations that have done this. One study of the rate of retraction over academic misconduct found the rate to be below average, but above the median, for the social sciences. (I’m aware that we would ideally disaggregate by field and look at the rate in economics, but [you can’t always get what you want](https://youtu.be/ZUqSNbJuGOw?si=2oJ_pytf4LHW5orL).) The rate of replication is [relatively low](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171031). Regardless, the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) is a problem for the sciences as a whole, so this doesn’t seem to be a reason to ignore economists while listening to other experts. Christensen and Miguel (2018) also included a couple of funnel plots that suggest estimated effects tend toward the same  value.

If the weak points of economics are too much for you and your definition of  is too strict to classify it that way, it’s still misleading and harmful to describe economics as unscientific. Economists put a lot of effort into documenting and studying the way the economy works in the  world. If the only work in economics were [this paper](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.4.187) showing import prices suddenly rising when tariffs are implemented, it would still be an informative field. Denouncing it as unscientific only serves to encourage  to ignore important empirical results.

I thought it would be good to take a moment to speculate about why  denounce economics as unscientific. The obvious answer, and I think the  one, is that  are inconvenienced by its findings and have ideological or political motivations that are easier to satisfy without empiricism. I also suspect that they ’t put nearly as much effort into rooting out ideology compared to economists. In any case, I’m only speculating about this, and the focus should always be on the ideas rather than the motivations of different speakers.

I’d like to introduce a challenge. I ’t think you can convincingly do either of these things:

* Establish a definition of  that clearly includes pharmacology but excludes economics.

* Establish that neither economics nor pharmacology are scientific. At the same time, establish that you should listen to doctors and take important medications like the COVID-19 vaccine while ignoring the advice of economists on public policy.

The two fields have oddly similar features in that the things they study are very complex, and estimates of treatment effects vary, making the summarization of existing literature difficult.

For now, I’m still going to have beautiful little microchips in my veins, and I’m still going to believe higher interest rates ’t cause inflation. Anyone who believes the laws of economics are mere social conventions is free to try defying these conventions by doubling their  supply.

Some of the things stated in the Levinovitz article, like “The discipline of economics, however, is presently so blinkered by the talismanic authority of mathematics that theories go overvalued and unchecked”, should be obviously misleading after reading the preceding text. Plenty of work is done to check economic theory; [that’s what the econometrics is for!](https://i.imgflip.com/88c50q.png?a485856) But I think it’s worthwhile to provide more detail about what’s wrong with everything else. The article has [already been R1’d on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics//4dex3l/economics_is_a_highly_paid_pseudoscience/d1qc1z6/), but I have my own commentary to add.

The plague of mathiness is a reasonable criticism, but not disqualifying for the field. You can simply ignore the difficult papers and focus on the easier ones, some of which are explained in [part 2](https://jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a--part-2) to demonstrate the usage of various econometric techniques. More importantly, economists like Romer and McCloskey—cited in the article as critics of mathiness—would never use ideas like “Economics isn’t a ” as a Trojan horse for idiotic policy choices. But nobody reading or citing articles like this will take the time to ask what these economists think when asked things like “Should the federal minimum wage be $30/hour?” Levinovitz was still happy to link his old article when  were criticizing the cranks, as if it would be taken as serious criticism rather than a mental escape route for idiots.

This might be taken to mean I ’t think there’s room for serious criticism of the field’s scientific norms, or lack thereof. I only mean that any such criticism should try to engage with how the field typically behaves, or otherwise make it clear that the problems it’s describing ’t generalize. Providing work like that in such a context is bad both for the content of the work and the way it’s presented, as a kind of “he’s , you know.” My own work includes plenty of good reasons to have doubts about some of the work economists do, but I wouldn’t use it in this way.

The obsession with the failure to predict the Great Recession makes the article much weaker as a criticism of the field as a whole. It works great only if the audience is uninformed enough to think the typical economist is some guy in a suit working at Goldman Sachs, looking at graphs of stock prices all day. Across three and a half years of study, I can remember being taught only *one* paper that used stock price data: a DiD study looking at how the stock prices of companies with and without much low-wage labor changed after the sudden announcement of a minimum wage hike. This was also one of the weakest pieces of work I saw, and that was admitted openly. (It only shows that investors think minimum wage hikes hurt prices, which is obvious.)

Reading [the cited essay from Paul Krugman](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html), I can’t help but get the feeling that economists are often giving in to a public demand for expert self-flagellation. An expert saying “the experts are wrong!” is a great way to appeal to Americans’ hatred of the idea that someone might know more than they do, especially about something as important as the economy. They’re happy to benefit from expertise when it carries them in a plane for thousands of miles, fixes their car, or keeps the economy out of a depression, but very upset when it obligates them to schedule an appointment for a vaccine or quit voting for institutionalized woo.

I ’t think we can permanently convince the general public to quit it. This forum and other spaces like it have been trying to put to rest the same nonsense for a long time. But I ’t think we should have any qualms about our prideful superiority until one of these  takes five minutes to scroll through an actual economics paper until they hit the section with regression output.","“ economics is not a  ” is the economics take of all time * against all the empirical results that academia can conjure , all the citations that online economics nerds can produce , the cranks send unto them… [ only you ] ( https : //x.com/oren_cass/status/1928801739840319520 ) . * i seriously mean what i ’ m saying .

id=10.1257/aer.20190687 ) , at least in comparison to others . that linked study found that receiving a diploma doesn ’ t seem to influence earnings much , but [ findings vary ] ( https : //onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/caje.12489 # caje12489-sec-0006 ) ; typically , [ estimates of the return to education are ] ( https : //www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09645292.2018.1484426 ) . it ’ s to the scientific content this adds to economics . if the assumptions of these methods are right—and they ’ re often reasonable—they identify causal effects using data from the  world , not assumptions and mathematical models . this is a contrast with the clouds punched in [ the previously-linked essay ] ( https : //aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers ) . it ’ s also a much way to understand the world than speculating based on our intuitions , since it allows us to avoid omitted variable , [ discussed at the beginning of part 2 ] ( https : //jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a--part-2 ) . but we ’ ve been burying the lede . what really counts as  , anyway ? that ’ s the focus of [ part 3 ] ( https : //jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a--part-3 ) , and it takes us on quite a detour from the field of economics . i ’ ll condense the philosophy and focus on the field of economics . in short : * early 20th-century philosophy of  was by the positivists , who believed ideas were only scientific ( or at all ) if they the verifiability criterion of meaning : statements are if they are empirically or tautological . * karl popper tried to solve both the demarcation ( what counts as  ? ) and the of induction ( how can we know that the future will be the past ? ) using falsificationism . this idea says that ideas are scientific if they are falsifiable and have thus far stood up to testing . * other views of  that came after popper focused more on the structure of scientific investigation and the norms that prevail in  . thomas kuhn is one of the more proponents of the former view , arguing that rather than falsifying one idea after another , sciences rely on paradigms , whole packages of ideas about the world and how to do  , and these shift over time . * skipping a lot , the typical philosopher of  today is a scientific realist , meaning they believe we all inhabit a common reality , and an * actual * ( it ’ s what scientists do ) and * * ( it ’ s possible ) aim of  is to describe reality . there are various ideas i presented in the larger post to defend the claim that economics is a  . i ’ ll them and give each in a paragraph . ideas in economics are often generalizations , the law of supply . popper described how generalizations this are not falsifiable but are instead falsifiable in a more probabilistic sense . you can ’ t the law of supply by pointing to a single case where it seemed not to apply ; you need to show it ’ s generally not true . you might argue that generalizations are not , but i provided a very formal description in the post that gives them meaning . in short , claiming you are very something is true or will happen can be taken to mean you are 90 % in it , and that statements you make with that degree of will happen ~90 % of the time after observations have been made . it ’ s to allow for some . economics does not have laws in the sense we mean when talking about the laws of physics . laws in physics are not generalizations , but also aren ’ t  “ things that are always true ” , “ there are no 10 km tall butter statues of ayn rand ” . the sense of “ law ”  usually mean is something a causal relationship that always holds , and as described by john t. roberts , physics has yet to discover any such laws . newton ’ s second law , for example , to hold at relativistic speeds . so while economics doesn ’ t have laws , physics laws as , and the most difference is that only physics can hope to one day find laws . using speculation about the possibility of laws to dismiss some things as not- and describe others as  is and , so both should be considered  . are economists too ideological and to be to new evidence ? the history of the field provides some cause for . say ’ s law used to be sacred among economists , but was by the . the field adjusted and the ideas of john maynard keynes . similarly , card and krueger ’ s study of the minimum wage hike in new jersey triggered a revision of the literature on the minimum wage , which has generally found [ negligible but usually effects on employment ] ( https : //www.ctdol.state.ct.us/lweab/doucougliagos % 20 & % 20stanley % 20publication % 20selection % 20bias % 20in % 20min % 20wage % 20research-a % 20metaregression % 20analysis.pdf ) . and ideas are also not disqualifying for a —physicists believed in an unobservable luminiferous ether for a long time before michelson and morley showed it didn ’ t exist with an experiment , and even that didn ’ t change everyone ’ s mind . einstein stated “ i am at all events convinced that he does not play dice ” in response to the random outcomes observed in quantum physics . waiting for even more evidence to emerge and explaining away results is  a part of  ; the part is that you eventually give in , at least on most . the field is greatly dependent on linear , explained at length in part 2. but these regressions give the appearance of being , since they try to analyze extremely systems by merely relating one variable to another . in part 3 , it ’ s shown that linear can , in principle , identify causal effects even when we are about the complexity of what ’ s being analyzed . the example used shows that it ’ s mostly to perform a of acceleration on force while being about mass if mass is uncorrelated with force . you are at least able to find the direction of the effect . this is the key assumption of exogeneity , or a of omitted variable . the field is also for consensus , but this is very . it ’ s true in many cases , but the field does have a consensus on a number of . survey data showing this can be found [ here ] ( https : //kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/ ) , [ here ] ( https : //www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/where-is-there-consensus-among-american-economic-historians-the-results-of-a-survey-on-forty-propositions/a0b369e27b4b1baffd29ab83cc53b718 ) , and [ here ] ( https : //www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18728/w18728.pdf ) . for example , back in 2012 , [ zero economists on the kent clark center ’ s panel ] ( https : //kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/laffer-curve/ ) agreed that cutting income taxes would raise revenue . 71 % , with the rest , having no opinion , or not answering . academic economists rarely identify with particular “ schools of thought ” found in the imagination , the austrian school , and even these schools agree with the rest of the field on most . some schools of thought , marxism , don ’ t even provide answers to the questions of to academic economists . there is no alternative marxist literature on the empirical minimum wage elasticity with to employment . potential with empirical research p-hacking don ’ t make the field look significantly than others . in fact , one study found that the reported share of p-values in the 0.01 to 0.05 range was lowest in economics and high elsewhere . major empirical methods appear to from some combination of p-hacking and publication , with rct and rdd less than iv and did . on balance , things don ’ t look too , but regardless , this has been an with the sciences in general for some time now . john ioannidis provided a quite of published research findings that apply to economics as , as described in christensen and miguel ( 2018 ) . but the scope of his claim , “ most published research findings are ” , is exaggerated . the key assumption of his model , derived from bayes ’ theorem , is a low prior probability that something is true . this prior is low for large , exploratory studies involving thousands of genes , where we only a small number to be related to a disease , as described in his paper . but when we ’ re talking about relationships in economics , the law of supply , the value of the prior probability is not obviously low and arguably . edward leamer ’ s 1983 paper “ let ’ s take the con out of econometrics ” expressed over economists publishing by trying large numbers of specifications for their models , made possible by what were then recent advancements in computational capacity . his suggested solution , transparently reporting all tested specifications , appears to have influenced econometric and how the subject is taught at universities . this is another reason for about the field ’ s ability to avoid statistical malpractice . and reproducibility appear to be two of the points for the field . there doesn ’ t appear to be any formal procedure for detecting and preventing in economics , though there are private organizations that have done this . one study of the rate of retraction over academic misconduct found the rate to be below average , but above the median , for the social sciences . ( i ’ m aware that we would disaggregate by field and look at the rate in economics , but [ you can ’ t always get what you want ] ( https : //youtu.be/zuqsnbjugow ? si=2oj_pytf4lhw5orl ) . ) the rate of replication is [ relatively low ] ( https : //www.aeaweb.org/articles ? id=10.1257/aer.p20171031 ) . regardless , the [ replication ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/replication_crisis ) is a for the sciences as a whole , so this doesn ’ t seem to be a reason to economists while listening to other experts . christensen and miguel ( 2018 ) also included a couple of funnel plots that suggest estimated effects tend toward the same  value . if the points of economics are too much for you and your definition of  is too to classify it that way , it ’ s still and to describe economics as unscientific . economists put a lot of effort into documenting and studying the way the economy in the  world . if the only in economics were [ this paper ] ( https : //pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.4.187 ) showing import prices suddenly rising when tariffs are implemented , it would still be an informative field . denouncing it as unscientific only serves to  to empirical results . i thought it would be to take a moment to speculate about why  economics as unscientific . the obvious answer , and i think the one , is that  are inconvenienced by its findings and have ideological or political motivations that are to without empiricism . i also that they don ’ t put nearly as much effort into rooting out ideology compared to economists . in any case , i ’ m only speculating about this , and the focus should always be on the ideas rather than the motivations of different speakers . i ’ d to introduce a challenge . i don ’ t think you can do either of these things : * establish a definition of  that includes pharmacology but excludes economics . * establish that neither economics nor pharmacology are scientific . at the same time , establish that you should listen to doctors and take medications the covid-19 vaccine while ignoring the advice of economists on public policy . the two fields have similar features in that the things they study are very , and estimates of treatment effects vary , making the summarization of existing literature . for now , i ’ m still going to have little microchips in my veins , and i ’ m still going to believe higher interest rates don ’ t cause inflation . anyone who believes the laws of economics are mere social conventions is to try defying these conventions by doubling their  supply . ___ some of the things stated in the levinovitz article , “ the discipline of economics , however , is presently so blinkered by the talismanic authority of mathematics that theories go overvalued and unchecked ” , should be obviously after reading the preceding text . plenty of is done to check economic theory ; [ that ’ s what the econometrics is for ! ] ( https : //i.imgflip.com/88c50q.png ? a485856 ) but i think it ’ s to provide more detail about what ’ s with everything else . the article has [ already been r1 ’ d on here ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics//4dex3l/economics_is_a_highly_paid_pseudoscience/d1qc1z6/ ) , but i have my own commentary to add . the of mathiness is a , but not disqualifying for the field . you can simply the papers and focus on the ones , some of which are explained in [ part 2 ] ( https : //jackonomics.substack.com/p/economics-is-a--part-2 ) to demonstrate the usage of various econometric techniques . more importantly , economists romer and mccloskey—cited in the article as of mathiness—would never use ideas “ economics isn ’ t a  ” as a trojan horse for policy choices . but nobody reading or citing articles this will take the time to ask what these economists think when asked things “ should the federal minimum wage be $ 30/hour ? ” levinovitz was still to link his old article when  were the cranks , as if it would be taken as serious rather than a mental escape route for . this might be taken to mean i don ’ t think there ’ s room for serious of the field ’ s scientific norms , or thereof . i only mean that any such should try to engage with how the field typically behaves , or otherwise make it that the it ’ s describing don ’ t generalize . providing that in such a context is both for the content of the and the way it ’ s presented , as a kind of “ he ’ s , you know. ” my own includes plenty of reasons to have about some of the economists do , but i wouldn ’ t use it in this way . the with the to predict the makes the article much as a of the field as a whole . it only if the audience is to think the typical economist is some guy in a suit working at goldman sachs , looking at graphs of stock prices all day . across three and a half years of study , i can remember being taught only * one * paper that used stock price data : a did study looking at how the stock prices of companies with and without much low-wage labor changed after the sudden announcement of a minimum wage hike . this was also one of the weakest pieces of i saw , and that was admitted . ( it only shows that investors think minimum wage hikes prices , which is obvious . ) reading [ the cited essay from paul krugman ] ( https : //www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06economic-t.html ) , i can ’ t help but get the feeling that economists are often giving in to a public demand for expert self-flagellation . an expert saying “ the experts are ! ” is a way to to americans ’ of the idea that someone might know more than they do , especially about something as as the economy . they ’ re to from expertise when it carries them in a plane for thousands of miles , fixes their car , or keeps the economy out of a , but very when it obligates them to schedule an appointment for a vaccine or quit voting for institutionalized . i don ’ t think we can permanently convince the general public to quit it . this forum and other spaces it have been trying to put to rest the same for a long time . but i don ’ t think we should have any about our until one of these  takes five minutes to scroll through an actual economics paper until they hit the section with output ."

But sure, let’s keep pretending this is  a “natural cycle” and not what happens when you let a sentient Big Mac combo meal run the country for four years.

Let’s recap for the folks in the back:
	•	Gutted environmental protections like it was a damn speedrun.
	•	Put coal execs and oil lobbyists in charge of federal agencies.
	•	Pulled out of the Paris Agreement because it hurt his feelings.
	•	Suggested we rake forests like we’re in a Disney movie.
	•	Said wind turbines cause cancer.

And now? Whole towns are burning down in JUNE and insurance companies are noping out of half the country — but MAGA Boomers are still out here going, “wElL aCtUaLlY it’s  bad forest management.” Bro, you think you’re smarter than climate scientists because you watched a PragerU video once?

Dougie has sold us taxpayers under the bus as his whims, like Trump does 

Yesterday, I wrote about Dougie Ford capitulating with Ford Motors and his pathetic refusal to ask for a refund of subsidies of $600 million for Ford Motors breach of promise to build a huge EV and battery plant in Oakville. 

BUT DOUGIE FORD HAS CONTINED TO WASTE OUR HARD-EARNED MONEY SINCE BECOMING PREMIER! 

I found a great and sourced article written to the editor of the Orillia Packet that lists all of the huge and very large amounts of waste of our tax dollars without consultation. 

These do not include the huge cost to demolish our world-class SCIENCE CENTRE that engineers found could be repaired and a much lower cost but Dougie wants it removed so his developer fiends can develop the land. 

PLUS hand over ONTARIO PLACE to International conglomerates without consulting the taxpayers. 

What happened to buying
Canadian? The bill fit this will be in the billions and all taxpayers of Ontario, even those who live too far to come to a Spa. 

BTW, Dougie came to power with a personal worth of 3 million and is now valued at 30 million.

When Mr. Ford took over the reins of power in 2018 here in Ontario, we had a very successful cap-and-trade initiative with California.

“Ontario joined the emissions market in 2017 and has raised more than $2 billion from the quarterly auctions.” (CalMatters, 2017)

Doug Ford without any consultation immediately cancelled this very successful program that actually reduced greenhouse gases.

“It cost the province $10.5 billion in lost revenues, legal fees and compensation for cancelled contracts.” (National Observer, May 19, 2022)

In Ontario, we did not pay any federal carbon tax until Ford cancelled cap and trade in 2018.

So, ironically, Ford, who never stopped railing against the carbon tax, is actually the person responsible for people in Ontario having to pay this tax.

I personally was happy to pay if it meant my grandchildren would not have to live with the alarming outcomes of climate chaos. As well, with the rebate I received, I think I got more money back than I paid in carbon tax. Ford then wasted another $30 million of taxpayers’ money when he lost his ill-advised lawsuit against the carbon tax.

After reading about many other greenhouse gas reductions programs he cancelled, I am beginning to believe that, like Trump, Ford thinks global overheating is a hoax.

Why are civil servants not allowed to use the words “climate change” on social media?

“The cancellation of 750 green energy programs, many of which were with First Nations, cost taxpayers $230 million.” (National Observer, May 19, 2022)

One of the programs that he cancelled was the White Pines wind project. This cancellation left taxpayers on the hook for another $100 million.

Ford’s indifference to the ecological health of our environment was further reinforced by the slashing of $162 million in funding for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (April 18, 2019) along with the recent announcement that the 50 Million Tree Program was being eliminated. (April 25, 2019)

And, the end of the Drive Clean program demonstrates clearly Ford has no understanding of the relationship between human health and breathing clean air.

The Ford government has also shown a complete disregard for the welfare of our children by cancelling the $500,000 the Wynne government had set aside to begin to repair our crumbling schools.

As well, he callously reneged on $ 500,000 on the after-school music programs for kids at risk. (Aug. 25, 2018)

So far, he has cut education funds to the tune of over half a billion dollars, negatively impacting every single aspect of child development from breakfast to mental health programs. (Nov. 5, 2021)

Knowing full well that many students do not have computers or access to the internet, Ford made it mandatory that secondary students take courses online.

Finally, Ford recklessly cut nearly $1 billion from the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services over three years. (April 12, 2019)

Then, just recently, he decided that all the residents of Ontario deserved a cheque of $200. I assumed it would be sent to only people who truly needed it to help make ends meet. You can imagine my shock and dismay when I discovered billionaires such as David Thomson with a net worth of $41.8 billion and Tobi Lütke with a net worth $8 billion got a cheque for $200 while many, many homeless people with a net worth of nothing got nothing.

So, by sending out tax payers’ hard-earned money to countless people who did not need it, Mr. Ford increased our debt load by another $3 billion.

Then, his very last gigantic waste of taxpayers’ dollars happened on the day he called an early election, which will cost taxpayers around $175 million.

I cannot think of a single premier of Ontario who has wasted more of taxpayers’ hard-earned money than Mr. Doug Ford.""",Unhappy_Minute8988,ontario,In-favor,Climate Change,"Doug Ford cited as Premier who has wasted more tax dollars than any other This is rather long but please bear with me as we all need to read a concise record of all of the tax dollars Dougie Ford has wasted.

My partner used to be a very warm and compassionate person, and our relationship was stable. However, since last year, after he started engaging with conspiracy theories, he has become increasingly irritable and prone to anger. He spends several hours a day consuming conspiracy-related content, including beliefs such as fake vaccines, the idea that a Jewish-led deep state is spreading toxins through airplane trails to kill humanity, that climate change is a hoax, that mass immigration is destroying Western culture and social safety, and that digital currencies are being introduced to control people’s assets.

Despite the concerns and efforts of his friends, family, and myself, he has not changed and seems to be falling deeper into this rabbit hole. He also pressures us to believe in what he believes, and whenever someone disagrees, he sees it as disrespect and disapproval. The emotional toll of hearing these hateful narratives every day is overwhelming. I’ve been trying to maintain my mental health through reading, socializing, exercise, and meditation, but I often feel like I’m standing on the edge of a cliff. Whenever I manage to find a fragile sense of balance, he seems to push harder and disrupt it. I feel helpless and miss the version of him who cherished our relationship.

I’ve tried listening and being attentive to his emotions. Occasionally, he seems to improve, but overall, he has started to distrust me and frequently loses his temper. He says he needs to vent in order to feel better and insists that “complaining” is a common and accepted part of Western culture—everyone does it. Furthermore, he believes that if someone can’t share his beliefs, then they must live in a completely different world. Therefore, if I can’t accept his behavior, he says it’s my own problem and that I should accept breaking up.

I’m currently reflecting on my boundaries, because I believe that only by taking care of myself first can I truly care for the people I love.

https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/1kr1dap/strategies_for_getting_headspace_getting_my_mum/,climate change is a hoax,Strategies for getting headspace / getting my mum out of my head!,"Hi everyone,  
I'm writing this post mainly to ask for advice and suggestions on how to protect my mental health after interactions with my mum. I'm also hoping that writing this all down will be a bit therapeutic in itself.

For context, I’m based in the UK, but my mum’s views are increasingly Q-adjacent. She’s a big supporter of Trump, Musk, and RFK Jr. When we visit my parents, we do our best to steer clear of any trigger topics, but it always reaches a point where she just can’t seem to hold back and launches into a flood of whatever conspiracy theories she’s been consuming online lately.

It's quite typical conspiratorial stuff I think - chemtrails are being used to control the weather, climate change is a myth, the moon landing was a hoax, Covid was a con, the vaccine has killed loads of people, everyone who ""supposedly"" died of Covid actually died of something else, Bill Gates wants to depopulate the earth, Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion. And she hates Keir Starmer and thinks he's part of some plot with the World Economic Forum. 

One of the sad things about it is that she thinks she's discovered all this special knowledge due to ""doing her own research"" but doesn't realise she's just been led down rabbitholes by YouTube algorithms and is parroting the same nonsense as many other people. One thing that really frustrates me is how she deliberately steers conversations toward topics that let her push her beliefs. For example, she'll ask about my cousin—who is autistic—with fake concern, just to segue into a rant about how vaccines supposedly cause autism.

Each time we see her it seems like her views have become more extreme, so I'm worried about the direction it's all heading in. At what point will she believe in lizard people, pizzagate, clones, medbeds etc? I've tried the methods to tackle it that are described on this forum, with limited success. I work in the media so she dismisses anything I say as to her I'm woke, liberal, naïve and too young to really understand how the world works (I turn 50 this year!). I hate it when she starts on one of her rants as her personality completely changes, and she becomes smug and patronising. She clearly wants me to jump down the rabbithole after her and also become consumed by anger and bitterness rather than appreciating the life we have. I love my mum, and worry about what this is doing to her, but I can't stand the way she preaches her beliefs. She’s always been an atheist, but the way she delivers her theories is strikingly similar to an evangelical preacher—fervent, unshakable, and relentless.

I think a lot of it stems from her being bored and unstimulated, and having a distrust of authority after the trauma of losing her beloved brother a decade ago due to medical negligence. She never has a good word to say about the NHS, and thinks she knows better than doctors - even though she and my dad wouldn't be alive today were it not for life saving hospital treatment, and I received amazing care throughout a very difficult pregnancy.

It's so emotionally draining, and afterwards it takes me weeks to decompress, as everything keeps going around in my mind. I'll be doing the washing up or playing with my daughter but in my head I'm arguing with my mum. 

I'm sure many people on this forum can relate to my experience. I also want to acknowledge that my situation is nowhere near as severe as what many families of QAnon addicts are going through. I'm so thankful that I don't live with my parents, and am so sorry for anyone who is dependent financially on their conspiracy obsessed parents, or dealing with this kind of thing with a spouse or a child. 

But if anyone has any strategies for achieving calm and headspace they would be much appreciated! It's just so exhausting and I want her out of my head. Please don't suggest going no contact though as I couldn't do that, because it would also mean cutting off my dad and my sister as they all live together.

At what point will she believe in lizard people, pizzagate, clones, medbeds etc? I've tried the methods to tackle it that are described on this forum, with limited success. I work in the media so she dismisses anything I say as to her I'm woke, liberal, naïve and too young to really understand how the world works (I turn 50 this year!). I hate it when she starts on one of her rants as her personality completely changes, and she becomes smug and patronising. She clearly wants me to jump down the rabbithole after her and also become consumed by anger and bitterness rather than appreciating the life we have. I love my mum, and worry about what this is doing to her, but I can't stand the way she preaches her beliefs. She’s always been an atheist, but the way she delivers her theories is strikingly similar to an evangelical preacher—fervent, unshakable, and relentless.

I think a lot of it stems from her being bored and unstimulated, and having a distrust of authority after the trauma of losing her beloved brother a decade ago due to medical negligence. She never has a good word to say about the NHS, and thinks she knows better than doctors - even though she and my dad wouldn't be alive today were it not for life saving hospital treatment, and I received amazing care throughout a very difficult pregnancy.

It's so emotionally draining, and afterwards it takes me weeks to decompress, as everything keeps going around in my mind. I'll be doing the washing up or playing with my daughter but in my head I'm arguing with my mum. 

I'm sure many people on this forum can relate to my experience. I also want to acknowledge that my situation is nowhere near as severe as what many families of QAnon addicts are going through.

Hi everyone,  
I'm writing this post mainly to ask for advice and suggestions on how to protect my mental health after interactions with my mum. I'm also hoping that writing this all down will be a bit therapeutic in itself.

For context, I’m based in the UK, but my mum’s views are increasingly Q-adjacent. She’s a big supporter of , Musk, and RFK Jr. When we visit my parents, we do our best to steer clear of any trigger topics, but it always reaches a point where she  can’t seem to hold back and launches into a flood of whatever conspiracy theories she’s been consuming online lately.

It's quite typical conspiratorial stuff I think - chemtrails are being used to control the weather, climate change is a myth, the moon landing was a , Covid was a con, the vaccine has killed loads of , everyone who ""supposedly"" died of Covid actually died of something else, Bill Gates wants to depopulate the earth, Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion. And she hates Keir Starmer and thinks he's part of some plot with the World Economic Forum. 

One of the sad things about it is that she thinks she's discovered all this special knowledge due to ""doing her own research"" but doesn't realise she's  been led down rabbitholes by YouTube algorithms and is parroting the same nonsense as many other . One thing that really frustrates me is how she deliberately steers conversations toward topics that let her push her beliefs. For example, she'll ask about my cousin—who is autistic—with fake concern,  to segue into a rant about how vaccines supposedly cause autism.

Each time we see her it seems like her views have become more extreme, so I'm worried about the direction it's all heading in. At what point will she believe in lizard , pizzagate, clones, medbeds etc? I've tried the methods to tackle it that are described on this forum, with limited success.

https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalIndia/comments/1l6rgvy/aryan_migration_theory_and_the_indoeuropean/,climate change is a hoax,Aryan Migration Theory and the Indo-European Language Tree is a White-Supremacist Hoax. Here's the Proof.,"My understanding regarding the Aryan Migration theory:

1. [No Evidence Yamnaya groups ever migrated to India in the timeframe for any supposed conquest to unite the languages](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711). — Source: [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711)

>*CONCLUSION*

>*Our findings reveal that the early spread of Yamnaya Bronze Age pastoralists had limited genetic impact in Anatolia as well as Central and South Asia. As such, the Asian story of Early Bronze Age expansions differs from that of Europe. Intriguingly, we find that direct descendants of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers of Central Asia, now extinct as a separate lineage, survived well into the Bronze Age. These groups likely engaged in early horse domestication as a prey-route transition from hunting to herding, as otherwise seen for reindeer. Our findings further suggest that West Eurasian ancestry entered South Asia before and after, rather than during, the initial expansion of western steppe pastoralists, with the later event consistent with a Late Bronze Age entry of IE languages into South Asia. Finally, the lack of steppe ancestry in samples from Anatolia indicates that the spread of the earliest branch of IE languages into that region was not associated with a major population migration from the steppe.*

1. [No Iranian farmer or Steppe Pastoral genome to support the conquest theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419309675) that the idea of an Indo-European language tree hinged on. — [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419309675](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419309675) the Source.

>*Summary*

>*We report an ancient genome from the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC). The individual we sequenced fits as a mixture of people related to ancient Iranians (the largest component) and* [*Southeast Asian*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/southeast-asians) *hunter-gatherers, a unique profile that matches ancient DNA from 11* [*genetic*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/genetics) *outliers from sites in Iran and Turkmenistan in cultural communication with the IVC. These individuals had little if any Steppe pastoralist-derived* [*ancestry*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/ancestry)*, showing that it was not ubiquitous in northwest South Asia during the IVC as it is today. The Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC derives from a* [*lineage*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lineages) *leading to early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter-gatherers before their ancestors separated, contradicting the hypothesis that the shared ancestry between early Iranians and South Asians reflects a large-scale spread of western Iranian farmers east.

To put it bluntly, as far as I can see from the available evidence, the Indo-European Language tree is more an invented hoax than anything based on evidentiary history.",JarinJove,HistoricalIndia,In-favor,Climate Change,"Aryan Migration Theory and the Indo-European Language Tree is a White-Supremacist Hoax. Here's the Proof. My understanding regarding the Aryan Migration theory:

1. [No Evidence Yamnaya groups ever migrated to India in the timeframe for any supposed conquest to unite the languages](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711). — Source: [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711)

>*CONCLUSION*

>*Our findings reveal that the early spread of Yamnaya Bronze Age pastoralists had limited genetic impact in Anatolia as well as Central and South Asia. As such, the Asian story of Early Bronze Age expansions differs from that of Europe. Intriguingly, we find that direct descendants of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers of Central Asia, now extinct as a separate lineage, survived well into the Bronze Age. These groups likely engaged in early horse domestication as a prey-route transition from hunting to herding, as otherwise seen for reindeer. Our findings further suggest that West Eurasian ancestry entered South Asia before and after, rather than during, the initial expansion of western steppe pastoralists, with the later event consistent with a Late Bronze Age entry of IE languages into South Asia. Finally, the lack of steppe ancestry in samples from Anatolia indicates that the spread of the earliest branch of IE languages into that region was not associated with a major population migration from the steppe.*

>*Summary*

>*We report an ancient genome from the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC). The individual we sequenced fits as a mixture of people related to ancient Iranians (the largest component) and* [*Southeast Asian*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/southeast-asians) *hunter-gatherers, a unique profile that matches ancient DNA from 11* [*genetic*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/genetics) *outliers from sites in Iran and Turkmenistan in cultural communication with the IVC. These individuals had little if any Steppe pastoralist-derived* [*ancestry*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/ancestry)*, showing that it was not ubiquitous in northwest South Asia during the IVC as it is today. The Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC derives from a* [*lineage*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lineages) *leading to early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter-gatherers before their ancestors separated, contradicting the hypothesis that the shared ancestry between early Iranians and South Asians reflects a large-scale spread of western Iranian farmers east. Instead, sampled ancient genomes from the Iranian plateau and IVC descend from different groups of hunter-gatherers who began farming without being connected by substantial movement of people.*

>*CONCLUSION*

>*Our findings reveal that the early spread of Yamnaya Bronze Age pastoralists had limited genetic impact in Anatolia as well as Central and South Asia. As such, the Asian story of Early Bronze Age expansions differs from that of Europe. Intriguingly, we find that direct descendants of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers of Central Asia, now extinct as a separate lineage, survived well into the Bronze Age. These groups likely engaged in early horse domestication as a prey-route transition from hunting to herding, as otherwise seen for reindeer. Our findings further suggest that West Eurasian ancestry entered South Asia before and after, rather than during, the initial expansion of western steppe pastoralists, with the later event consistent with a Late Bronze Age entry of IE languages into South Asia. Finally, the lack of steppe ancestry in samples from Anatolia indicates that the spread of the earliest branch of IE languages into that region was not associated with a major population migration from the steppe.*

1. To get a clearer picture of how badly this  has been debunked, there’s now evidence showing that the upper-half of India was in fact speaking an off-shoot of the proto-Dravidian language. [The basis is that there’s good evidence to support that the ancient Indus Valley were multilingual speakers and speaking multiple languages was more commonplace in very ancient times](https://www.indiatoday.in//story/indus-valley--spoke-ancient-dravidian-language-claims-new-research-1842718-2021-08-19). — Source: [https://www.indiatoday.in//story/indus-valley--spoke-ancient-dravidian-language-claims-new-research-1842718-2021-08-19](https://www.indiatoday.in//story/indus-valley--spoke-ancient-dravidian-language-claims-new-research-1842718-2021-08-19)

>*The Indus Valley Civilisation, the earliest known urban culture of the Indian subcontinent, has always been a source of intrigue and a source to look back into the past. A new observation sheds light on the language of this ancient civilisation, which could have its roots in ancestral Dravidian languages.*

>*Bahata Ansumali Mukhopadhyay, an independent researcher, analysed numerous archaeological, linguistic, and historical evidence to find that the words used for elephant — piri’, ‘piru — in Bronze Age Mesopotamia were originally borrowed from — ‘pilu’ — a Proto-Dravidian word for elephant, which was prevalent in the Indus Valley Civilisation.*

>From One:

***NS:*** *Many  hold that there was an 'Aryan Invasion' which destroyed the Harappan Civilization. How far is this true?*

>***Lal:*** *Let us first go to the background against which the 'Aryan Invasion' theory emerged. In the 19\*\***^(th)* *century, Max Muller, a German Indologist, dated the Vedas to 1200 BCE. Accepting that the Sutras existed around 600 BCE and assigning 200 years to each of the preceding stages, namely those of the Aranyakas, Brahmanas, and Vedas, he arrived at the magic figure of 1,200 BCE.*

>*There were serious objections to such ad-hocism by contemporary scholars, like Goldstucker, Whitney, and Wilson. Thus cornered, Max Muller finally surrendered by stating: ""Whether the Vedic hymns were composed in 1000 or 1500 or 2000 or 3000 BC, no power on earth will ever determine."" But the great pity is that some scholars even today cling to 1200 BCE and dare not cross this Lakshamana Rekha!*

>*In the 1920s, the Harappan Civilization was discovered and dated to 3\*\***^(rd)* *millennium BCE on the basis of its contacts with West Asian civilizations. Since the Vedas had already been dated, be it wrongly, to 1200 BCE, the Harappan Civilization was declared to be Non-Vedic. And since the only other major language group in India was the Dravidian, it was readily assumed that the Harappans was a Dravidian-speaking .*

>*In 1946, Wheeler discovered a fort at Harappa; and since the Aryan god Indra has been mentioned in the Rigveda as puramdara, i.e. 'destroyer of forts', he lost no time in declaring that Aryan Invaders destroyed the Harappan Civilization.*

>*In the excavations at Mohenjo-Daro, some human skeletons had been found. In support of his 'Invasion' theory, Wheeler stated that these were the  who had been massacred by the invaders. However, since the skeletons had been found at* ***different*** ***stratigraphic levels*** *and could not, therefore, be related to a single event, much less to an invasion, Wheeler's theory was prima facie wrong. Dales, an American archeologist, has rightly dubbed it as a 'mythical massacre'.*

>*Indeed,* ***there is no evidence whatsoever of an invasion at any of the hundreds of Harappan sites.*** *On the other hand, there is ample evidence of continuity of habitation, though marked by gradual cultural devolution.*

>*A detailed study of human skeletal remains from various sites by Hemphill and his colleagues has established that* ***no new  at all entered India between 4500 and 800 BCE.***

\----

>From Two:  
**Nithin Sridhar:** If the Aryans were neither 'Invaders' nor 'Immigrants', were they 'Indigenous'?

>**B.B. Lal:** To answer this question, we must first settle the date of the *Rigveda* **since the entire mess has been created by wrongly dating the Vedas to 1200 BCE**\*.\*

>In this context, the history of the River Sarasvati plays a very vital role. In the *Rigveda,* it has been referred to as a mighty river, originating in the Himalayas and flowing all the way down to the ocean *(RV* 7.95.2)*.* But by the time of the *Panchavimsha Brahmana* (XXV.10.16) it had dried up.

>Against this literary background, let us see what archaeology and other sciences have to say in the matter.

>Along the bank of the Sarasvati (now called the Ghaggar) is located Kalibangan, a site of the Harappan Civilization. It had to be abandoned while it was still in a mature stage, owing to the drying up of the adjacent river. According to the radiocarbon dates, this abandonment took place around 2000.

>Since, as already stated, during the Rigvedic times the Sarasvati was a mighty flowing river and it dried up around 2,000 BCE, the ***Rigveda*** **has got to be earlier than 2000 BCE.** How much earlier is anybody's guess; but at least a 3^(rd) millennium BCE horizon is indicated.

>Further, Rigveda X.75.5-6 very clearly defines the area occupied by Rigvedic , in the 3^(rd) millennium BCE, as follows:

>*imam me Gaṅge Yamune Sarasvati Śutudri stotam sachatā Parus̩n̩yā /* *Asiknyā Marudvr̩idhe Vitastayā Ārjīkīye śr̩in̩uhya- Sus̩omayā // 5 //*

>*Tr̩is̩tāmayā prathamam yātave sajūh̩.Susartvā Rasayā Śvetyā tyā /* *Tvam Sindho Kubhayā Gomatīm Krumum Mehatnvā saratham yābhir̄iyase* // 6 //

>Which means the area occupied by Rigvedic  was from the upper reaches of the Ganga-Yamuna on the east to the Indus and its western tributaries on the west.

1. Finally, Rochester Institute of Technology, Assistant Professor of the School of Mathematical Sciences, Nishant Malik, put [the final nail in the coffin with the mathematical model showing a Global Ice Age contributing to an eventual massive drought of the monsoon season of the Indus Valley Civilization was the  reason](https://www.rit.edu/news/new-mathematical-method-shows-how-climate-change-led-fall-ancient-civilization#:~:text=RIT%20Assistant%20Professor%20Nishant%20Malik%20developed%20a%20mathematical%20method%20that,fall%20of%20the%20ancient%20civilization.&text=Malik%20developed%20a%20method%20to,past%20climates%20using%20indirect%20observations) for the fall of the Harrapan civilization when studying historic weather patterns of the ancient world.

>*There are several theories about why the Indus Valley Civilization declined—including invasion by nomadic Indo-Aryans and earthquakes—but climate change appears to be the most likely scenario. But until Malik applied his hybrid approach— rooted in dynamical systems but also draws on methods from the fields of machine learning and information theory—there was no mathematical proof. His analysis showed there was a major shift in monsoon patterns  before the dawn of this civilization and that the pattern reversed course  before it declined, indicating it was in fact climate change that caused the fall.*

>*Malik said he hopes the method will allow scientists to develop more automated methods of finding transitions in paleoclimate data and leads to additional important historical discoveries.

I was sitting in my hideout watching cartoons when the news bulletin broke in on my video feed, announcing that James Halliday had died during the night. I’d heard of Halliday, of course. Everyone had. He was the videogame designer responsible for creating the OASIS, a massively multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved into the globally networked virtual reality most of humanity now used on a daily basis. The unprecedented success of the OASIS had made Halliday one of the wealthiest people in the world. At first, I couldn’t understand why the media was making such a big deal of the billionaire’s death. After all, the people of Planet Earth had other concerns. The ongoing energy crisis. Catastrophic climate change. Widespread famine, poverty, and disease. Half a dozen wars. You know: “dogs and cats living together … mass hysteria!” Normally, the newsfeeds didn’t interrupt everyone’s interactive sitcoms and soap operas unless something really major had happened. Like the outbreak of some new killer virus, or another major city vanishing in a mushroom cloud. Big stuff like that. As famous as he was, Halliday’s death should have warranted only a brief segment on the evening news, so the unwashed masses could shake their heads in envy when the newscasters announced the obscenely large amount of money that would be doled out to the rich man’s heirs.  But that was the rub. James Halliday had no heirs.  
He had died a sixty-seven-year-old bachelor, with no living relatives and, by most accounts, without a single friend. He’d spent the last fifteen years of his life in self-imposed isolation, during which time—if the rumors were to be believed—he’d gone completely insane. So the real jaw-dropping news that January morning, the news that had everyone from Toronto to Tokyo crapping in their cornflakes, concerned the contents of Halliday’s last will and testament, and the fate of his vast fortune.  
  
  Halliday had prepared a short video message, along with instructions that it be released to the world media at the time of his death. He’d also arranged to have a copy of the video e-mailed to every single OASIS user that same morning. I still remember hearing the familiar electronic chime when it arrived in my inbox, just a few seconds after I saw that first news bulletin.  
  
  His video message was actually a meticulously constructed short film titled Anorak’s Invitation. A famous eccentric, Halliday had harbored a lifelong obsession with the 1980s, the decade during which he’d been a teenager, and Anorak’s Invitation was crammed with obscure ’80s pop culture references, nearly all of which were lost on me the first time I viewed it.  
  
  The entire video was just over five minutes in length, and in the days and weeks that followed, it would become the most scrutinized piece of film in history, surpassing even the Zapruder film in the amount of painstaking frame-by-frame analysis devoted to it. My entire generation would come to know every second of Halliday’s message by heart.  
  
  Anorak’s Invitation begins with the sound of trumpets, the opening of an old song called “Dead Man’s Party.”  
  
  The song plays over a dark screen for the first few seconds, until the trumpets are joined by a guitar, and that’s when Halliday appears. But he’s not a sixty-seven-year-old man, ravaged by time and illness. He looks just as he did on the cover of Time magazine back in 2014, a tall, thin, healthy man in his early forties, with unkempt hair and his trademark horn-rimmed eyeglasses. He’s also wearing the same clothing he wore in the Time cover photo: faded jeans and a vintage Space Invaders T-shirt.  
  
  Halliday is at a high-school dance being held in a large gymnasium. He’s surrounded by teenagers whose clothing, hairstyles, and dance moves all indicate that the time period is the late 1980s.\* Halliday is dancing, too—something no one ever saw him do in real life. Grinning maniacally, he spins in rapid circles, swinging his arms and head in time with the song, flawlessly cycling through several signature ’80s dance moves. But Halliday has no dance partner. He is, as the saying goes, dancing with himself.  
  
  A few lines of text appear briefly at the lower left-hand corner of the screen, listing the name of the band, the song’s title, the record label, and the year of release, as if this were an old music video airing on MTV: Oingo Boingo, “Dead Man’s Party,” MCA Records, 1985.  
  
  When the lyrics kick in, Halliday begins to lip-synch along, still gyrating: “All dressed up with nowhere to go. Walking with a dead man over my shoulder. Don’t run away, it’s only me.…”  
  
  He abruptly stops dancing and makes a cutting motion with his right hand, silencing the music. At the same moment, the dancers and the gymnasium behind him vanish, and the scene around him suddenly changes.  
  
  Halliday now stands at the front of a funeral parlor, next to an open casket.† A second, much older Halliday lies inside the casket, his body emaciated and ravaged by cancer. Shiny quarters cover each of his eyelids.

The younger Halliday gazes down at the corpse of his older self with mock sadness, then turns to address the assembled mourners.§ Halliday snaps his fingers and a scroll appears in his right hand. He opens it with a flourish and it unfurls to the floor, unraveling down the aisle in front of him. He breaks the fourth wall, addressing the viewer, and begins to read.  
  
  “I, James Donovan Halliday, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby make, publish, and declare this instrument to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made.…” He continues reading, faster and faster, plowing through several more paragraphs of legalese, until he’s speaking so rapidly that the words are unintelligible. Then he stops abruptly. “Forget it,” he says. “Even at that speed, it would take me a month to read the whole thing. Sad to say, I don’t have that kind of time.” He drops the scroll and it vanishes in a shower of gold dust. “Let me just give you the highlights.”  
  
  The funeral parlor vanishes, and the scene changes once again. Halliday now stands in front of an immense bank vault door. “My entire estate, including a controlling share of stock in my company, Gregarious Simulation Systems, is to be placed in escrow until such time as a single condition I have set forth in my will is met. The first individual to meet that condition will inherit my entire fortune, currently valued in excess of two hundred and forty billion dollars.”  
  
  The vault door swings open and Halliday walks inside. The interior of the vault is enormous, and it contains a huge stack of gold bars, roughly the size of a large house. “Here’s the dough I’m putting up for grabs,” Halliday says, grinning broadly. “What the hell. You can’t take it with you, right?”  
  
  Halliday leans against the stack of gold bars, and the camera pulls in tight on his face. “Now, I’m sure you’re wondering, what do you have to do to get your hands on all this moolah? Well, hold your horses, kids. I’m getting to that.…” He pauses dramatically, his expression changing to that of a child about to reveal a very big secret.  
  
  Halliday snaps his fingers again and the vault disappears. In the same instant, Halliday shrinks and morphs into a small boy wearing brown corduroys and a faded The Muppet Show T-shirt.\* The young Halliday stands in a cluttered living room with burnt orange carpeting, wood-paneled walls, and kitschy late-’70s decor. A 21-inch Zenith television sits nearby, with an Atari 2600 game console hooked up to it.  
  
  “This was the first videogame system I ever owned,” Halliday says, now in a child’s voice. “An Atari 2600. I got it for Christmas in 1979.” He plops down in front of the Atari, picks up a joystick, and begins to play. “My favorite game was this one,” he says, nodding at the TV screen, where a small square is traveling through a series of simple mazes. “It was called Adventure. Like many early videogames, Adventure was designed and programmed by just one person. But back then, Atari refused to give its programmers credit for their work, so the name of a game’s creator didn’t actually appear anywhere on the packaging.” On the TV screen, we see Halliday use a sword to slay a red dragon, although due to the game’s crude low-resolution graphics, this looks more like a square using an arrow to stab a deformed duck.  
  
  “So the guy who created Adventure, a man named Warren Robinett, decided to hide his name inside the game itself. He hid a key in one of the game’s labyrinths. If you found this key, a small pixel-sized gray dot, you could use it to enter a secret room where Robinett had hidden his name.” On the TV, Halliday guides his square protagonist into the game’s secret room, where the words CREATED BY WARREN ROBINETT appear in the center of the screen.  
  
  “This,” Halliday says, pointing to the screen with genuine reverence, “was the very first videogame Easter egg. Robinett hid it in his game’s code without telling a soul, and Atari manufactured and shipped Adventure all over the world without knowing about the secret room. They didn’t find out about the Easter egg’s existence until a few months later, when kids all over the world began to discover it. I was one of those kids, and finding Robinett’s Easter egg for the first time was one of the coolest videogaming experiences of my life.”  
  
  The young Halliday drops his joystick and stands. As he does, the living room fades away, and the scene shifts again. Halliday now stands in a dim cavern, where light from unseen torches flickers off the damp walls. In the same instant, Halliday’s appearance also changes once again, as he morphs into his famous OASIS avatar, Anorak—a tall, robed wizard with a slightly more handsome version of the adult Halliday’s face (minus the eyeglasses). Anorak is dressed in his trademark black robes, with his avatar’s emblem (a large calligraphic letter “A”) embroidered on each sleeve.  
  
  “Before I died,” Anorak says, speaking in a much deeper voice, “I created my own Easter egg, and hid it somewhere inside my most popular videogame—the OASIS. The first person to find my Easter egg will inherit my entire fortune.”  
  
  Another dramatic pause.  
  
  “The egg is well hidden. I didn’t just leave it lying under a rock somewhere. I suppose you could say that it’s locked inside a safe that is buried in a secret room that lies hidden at the center of a maze located somewhere”—he reaches up to tap his right temple—“up here.  
  
  “But don’t worry. I’ve left a few clues lying around to get everyone started. And here’s the first one.” Anorak makes a grand gesture with his right hand, and three keys appear, spinning slowly in the air in front of him. They appear to be made of copper, jade, and clear crystal. As the keys continue to spin, Anorak recites a piece of verse, and as he speaks each line, it appears briefly in flaming subtitles across the bottom of screen:  
  
  Three hidden keys open three secret gates  
  
  Wherein the errant will be tested for worthy traits  
  
  And those with the skill to survive these straits  
  
  Will reach The End where the prize awaits  
  
  As he finishes, the jade and crystal keys vanish, leaving only the copper key, which now hangs on a chain around Anorak’s neck.  
  
  The camera follows Anorak as he turns and continues farther into the dark cavern. A few seconds later, he arrives at a pair of massive wooden doors set into the cavern’s rocky wall. These doors are banded with steel, and there are shields and dragons carved into their surfaces. “I couldn’t playtest this particular game, so I worry that I may have hidden my Easter egg a little too well. Made it too difficult to reach. I’m not sure. If that’s the case, it’s too late to change anything now. So I guess we’ll see.”  
  
  Anorak throws open the double doors, revealing an immense treasure room filled with piles of glittering gold coins and jewel-encrusted goblets.\* Then he steps into the open doorway and turns to face the viewer, stretching out his arms to hold open the giant double doors.†  
  
  “So without further ado,” Anorak announces, “let the hunt for Halliday’s Easter egg begin!” Then he vanishes in a flash of light, leaving the viewer to gaze through the open doorway at the glittering mounds of treasure that lay beyond.  
  
  Then the screen fades to black.  
  
  At the end of the video, Halliday included a link to his personal website, which had changed drastically on the morning of his death. For over a decade, the only thing posted there had been a short looping animation that showed his avatar, Anorak, sitting in a medieval library, hunched over a scarred worktable, mixing potions and poring over dusty spellbooks, with a large painting of a black dragon visible on the wall behind him.  
  
  But now that animation was gone, and in its place there was a high-score list like those that used to appear in old coin-operated videogames. The list had ten numbered spots, and each displayed the initials JDH—James Donovan Halliday—followed by a score of six zeros. This high-score list quickly came to be known as “the Scoreboard.”  
  
  Just below the Scoreboard was an icon that looked like a small leather-bound book, which linked to a free downloadable copy of Anorak’s Almanac, a collection of hundreds of Halliday’s undated journal entries. The Almanac was over a thousand pages long, but it co  
ntained few details about Halliday’s personal life or his day-to-day activities. Most of the entries were his stream-of-consciousness observations on various classic videogames, science-fiction and fantasy novels, movies, comic books, and ’80s pop culture, mixed with humorous diatribes denouncing everything from organized religion to diet soda.  
  
  The Hunt, as the contest came to be known, quickly wove its way into global culture. Like winning the lottery, finding Halliday’s Easter egg became a popular fantasy among adults and children alike. It was a game anyone could play, and at first, there seemed to be no right or wrong way to play it. The only thing Anorak’s Almanac seemed to indicate was that a familiarity with Halliday’s various obsessions would be essential to finding the egg. This led to a global fascination with 1980s pop culture. Fifty years after the decade had ended, the movies, music, games, and fashions of the 1980s were all the rage once again. By 2041, spiked hair and acid-washed jeans were back in style, and covers of hit ’80s pop songs by contemporary bands dominated the music charts. People who had actually been teenagers in the 1980s, all now approaching old age, had the strange experience of seeing the fads and fashions of their youth embraced and studied by their grandchildren.  
  
  A new subculture was born, composed of the millions of people who now devoted every free moment of their lives to searching for Halliday’s egg. At first, these individuals were known simply as “egg hunters,” but this was quickly truncated to the nickname “gunters.”  
  
  During the first year of the Hunt, being a gunter was highly fashionable, and nearly every OASIS user claimed to be one.  
  
  When the first anniversary of Halliday’s death arrived, the fervor surrounding the contest began to die down. An entire year had passed and no one had found anything. Not a single key or gate. Part of the problem was the sheer size of the OASIS. It contained thousands of simulated worlds where the keys might be hidden, and it could take a gunter years to conduct a thorough search of any one of them.  
  
  Despite all of the “professional” gunters who boasted on their blogs that they were getting closer to a breakthrough every day, the truth gradually became apparent: No one really even knew exactly what it was they were looking for, or where to start looking for it.  
  
  Another year passed.  
  
  And another.  
  
  Still nothing.  
  
  The general public lost all interest in the contest. People began to assume it was all just an outlandish hoax perpetrated by a rich nut job. Others believed that even if the egg really did exist, no one was ever going to find it. Meanwhile, the OASIS continued to evolve and grow in popularity, protected from takeover attempts and legal challenges by the ironclad terms of Halliday’s will and the army of rabid lawyers he had tasked with administering his estate.  
  
  Halliday’s Easter egg gradually moved into the realm of urban legend, and the ever-dwindling tribe of gunters gradually became the object of ridicule. Each year, on the anniversary of Halliday’s death, newscasters jokingly reported on their continued lack of progress. And each year, more gunters called it quits, concluding that Halliday had indeed made the egg impossible to find.  
  
  And another year went by.  
  
  And another.  
  
  Then, on the evening of February 11, 2045, an avatar’s name appeared at the top of the Scoreboard, for the whole world to see. After five long years, the Copper Key had finally been found, by an eighteen-year-old kid living in a trailer park on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.  
  
  That kid was me.  
  
  Dozens of books, cartoons, movies, and miniseries have attempted to tell the story of everything that happened next, but every single one of them got it wrong. So I want to set the record straight, once and for all.  
  
  \* Careful analysis of this scene reveals that all of the teenagers behind Halliday are actually extras from various John Hughes teen films who have been digitally cut-and-pasted into the video.  
  
  † His surroundings are actually from a scene in the 1989 film Heathers. Halliday appears to have digitally re-created the funeral parlor set and then inserted himself into it.  
  
  ‡ High-resolution scrutiny reveals that both quarters were minted in 1984.  
  
  § The mourners are actually all actors and extras from the same funeral scene in Heathers. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater are clearly visible in the audience, sitting near the back.  
  
  \* Halliday now looks exactly as he did in a school photo taken in 1980, when he was eight years old.  
  
  \* Analysis reveals dozens of curious items hidden among the mounds of treasure, most notably: several early home computers (an Apple IIe, a Commodore 64, an Atari 800XL, and a TRS-80 Color Computer 2), dozens of videogame controllers for a variety of game systems, and hundreds of polyhedral dice like those used in old tabletop role-playing games.  
  
  † A freeze-frame of this scene appears nearly identical to a painting by Jeff Easley that appeared on the cover of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, a Dungeons & Dragons rulebook published in 1983.  
  
  Being human totally sucks most of the time.  
  
  Videogames are the only thing that

  —Anorak’s Almanac, Chapter 91, Verses 1–2  
  
  I was jolted awake by the sound of gunfire in one of the neighboring stacks. The shots were followed by a few minutes of muffled shouting and screaming, then silence.  
  
  Gunfire wasn’t uncommon in the stacks, but it still shook me up. I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep, so I decided to kill the remaining hours until dawn by brushing up on a few coin-op classics. Galaga, Defender, Asteroids. These games were outdated digital dinosaurs that had become museum pieces long before I was born. But I was a gunter, so I didn’t think of them as quaint low-res antiques. To me, they were hallowed artifacts. Pillars of the pantheon. When I played the classics, I did so with a determined sort of reverence.  
  
  I was curled up in an old sleeping bag in the corner of the trailer’s tiny laundry room, wedged into the gap between the wall and the dryer. I wasn’t welcome in my aunt’s room across the hall, which was fine by me. I preferred to crash in the laundry room anyway. It was warm, it afforded me a limited amount of privacy, and the wireless reception wasn’t too bad. And, as an added bonus, the room smelled like liquid detergent and fabric softener. The rest of the trailer reeked of cat piss and abject poverty.  
  
  Most of the time I slept in my hideout. But the temperature had dropped below zero the past few nights, and as much as I hated staying at my aunt’s place, it still beat freezing to death.  
  
  A total of fifteen people lived in my aunt’s trailer. She slept in the smallest of its three bedrooms. The Depperts lived in the bedroom adjacent to hers, and the Millers occupied the large master bedroom at the end of the hall. There were six of them, and they paid the largest share of the rent. Our trailer wasn’t as crowded as some of the other units in the stacks. It was a double-wide. Plenty of room for everybody.  
  
  I pulled out my laptop and powered it on. It was a bulky, heavy beast, almost ten years old. I’d found it in a trash bin behind the abandoned strip mall across the highway. I’d been able to coax it back to life by replacing its system memory and reloading the stone-age operating system. The processor was slower than a sloth by current standards, but it was fine for my needs. The laptop served as my portable research library, video arcade, and home theater system. Its hard drive was filled with old books, movies, TV show episodes, song files, and nearly every videogame made in the twentieth century.  
  
  I booted up my emulator and selected Robotron: 2084, one of my all-time favorite games. I’d always loved its frenetic pace and brutal simplicity. Robotron was all about instinct and reflexes. Playing old videogames never failed to clear my mind and set me at ease. If I was feeling depressed or frustrated about my lot in life, all I had to do was tap the Player One button, and my worries would instantly slip away as my mind focused itself on the relentless pixelated onslaught on the screen in front of me. There, inside the game’s two-dimensional universe, life was simple: It’s just you against the machin  
e. Move with your left hand, shoot with your right, and try to stay alive as long as possible.  
  
  I spent a few hours blasting through wave after wave of Brains, Spheroids, Quarks, and Hulks in my unending battle to Save the Last Human Family! But eventually my fingers started to cramp up and I began to lose my rhythm. When that happened at this level, things deteriorated quickly. I burned through all of my extra lives in a matter of minutes, and my two least-favorite words appeared on the screen: GAME OVER.  
  
  I shut down the emulator and began to browse through my video files. Over the past five years, I’d downloaded every single movie, TV show, and cartoon mentioned in Anorak’s Almanac. I still hadn’t watched all of them yet, of course. That would probably take decades.  
  
  I selected an episode of Family Ties, an ’80s sitcom about a middleclass family living in central Ohio. I’d downloaded the show because it had been one of Halliday’s favorites, and I figured there was a chance that some clue related to the Hunt might be hidden in one of the episodes. I’d become addicted to the show immediately, and had now watched all 180 episodes, multiple times. I never seemed to get tired of them.  
  
  Sitting alone in the dark, watching the show on my laptop, I always found myself imagining that I lived in that warm, well-lit house, and that those smiling, understanding people were my family. That there was nothing so wrong in the world that we couldn’t sort it out by the end of a single half-hour episode (or maybe a two-parter, if it was something really serious).  
  
  My own home life had never even remotely resembled the one depicted in Family Ties, which was probably why I loved the show so much. I was the only child of two teenagers, both refugees who’d met in the stacks where I’d grown up. I don’t remember my father. When I was just a few months old, he was shot dead while looting a grocery store during a power blackout. The only thing I really knew about him was that he loved comic books. I’d found several old flash drives in a box of his things, containing complete runs of The Amazing Spider-Man, The X-Men, and Green Lantern. My mom once told me that my dad had given me an alliterative name, Wade Watts, because he thought it sounded like the secret identity of a superhero. Like Peter Parker or Clark Kent. Knowing that made me think he must have been a cool guy, despite how he’d died.  
  
  My mother, Loretta, had raised me on her own. We’d lived in a small RV in another part of the stacks. She had two full-time OASIS jobs, one as a telemarketer, the other as an escort in an online brothel. She used to make me wear earplugs at night so I wouldn’t hear her in the next room, talking dirty to tricks in other time zones. But the earplugs didn’t work very well, so I would watch old movies instead, with the volume turned way up.  
  
  I was introduced to the OASIS at an early age, because my mother used it as a virtual babysitter. As soon as I was old enough to wear a visor and a pair of haptic gloves, my mom helped me create my first OASIS avatar. Then she stuck me in a corner and went back to work, leaving me to explore an entirely new world, very different from the one I’d known up until then.  
  
  From that moment on, I was more or less raised by the OASIS’s interactive educational programs, which any kid could access for free. I spent a big chunk of my childhood hanging out in a virtual-reality simulation of Sesame Street, singing songs with friendly Muppets and playing interactive games that taught me how to walk, talk, add, subtract, read, write, and share. Once I’d mastered those skills, it didn’t take me long to discover that the OASIS was also the world’s biggest public library, where even a penniless kid like me had access to every book ever written, every song ever recorded, and every movie, television show, videogame, and piece of artwork ever created. The collected knowledge, art, and amusements of all human civilization were there, waiting for me. But gaining access to all of that information turned out to be something of a mixed blessing. Because that was when I found out the truth.  
  
  I don’t know, maybe your experience differed from mine. For me, growing up as a human being on the planet Earth in the twenty-first century was a real kick in the teeth. Existentially speaking.  
  
  The worst thing about being a kid was that no one told me the truth about my situation. In fact, they did the exact opposite. And, of course, I believed them, because I was just a kid and I didn’t know any better. I mean, Christ, my brain hadn’t even grown to full size yet, so how could I be expected to know when the adults were bullshitting me?  
  
  So I swallowed all of the dark ages nonsense they fed me. Some time passed. I grew up a little, and I gradually began to figure out that pretty much everyone had been lying to me about pretty much everything since the moment I emerged from my mother’s womb.  
  
  This was an alarming revelation.  
  
  It gave me trust issues later in life.  
  
  I started to figure out the ugly truth as soon as I began to explore the free OASIS libraries. The facts were right there waiting for me, hidden in old books written by people who weren’t afraid to be honest. Artists and scientists and philosophers and poets, many of them long dead. As I read the words they’d left behind, I finally began to get a grip on the situation. My situation. Our situation. What most people referred to as “the human condition.”  
  
  It was not good news.  
  
  I wish someone had just told me the truth right up front, as soon as I was old enough to understand it. I wish someone had just said:  
  
  “Here’s the deal, Wade. You’re something called a ‘human being.’ That’s a really smart kind of animal. Like every other animal on this planet, we’re descended from a single-celled organism that lived millions of years ago. This happened by a process called evolution, and you’ll learn more about it later. But trust me, that’s really how we all got here. There’s proof of it everywhere, buried in the rocks. That story you heard? About how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named God who lives up in the sky? Total bullshit. The whole God thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that people have been telling one another for thousands of years. We made it all up. Like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.  
  
  “Oh, and by the way … there’s no Santa Claus or Easter Bunny. Also bullshit. Sorry, kid. Deal with it.  
  
  “You’re probably wondering what happened before you got here. An awful lot of stuff, actually. Once we evolved into humans, things got pretty interesting. We figured out how to grow food and domesticate animals so we didn’t have to spend all of our time hunting. Our tribes got much bigger, and we spread across the entire planet like an unstoppable virus. Then, after fighting a bunch of wars with each other over land, resources, and our made-up gods, we eventually got all of our tribes organized into a ‘global civilization.’ But, honestly, it wasn’t all that organized, or civilized, and we continued to fight a lot of wars with each other. But we also figured out how to do science, which helped us develop technology. For a bunch of hairless apes, we’ve actually managed to invent some pretty incredible things. Computers. Medicine. Lasers. Microwave ovens. Artificial hearts. Atomic bombs. We even sent a few guys to the moon and brought them back. We also created a global communications network that lets us all talk to each other, all around the world, all the time. Pretty impressive, right?  
  
  “But that’s where the bad news comes in. Our global civilization came at a huge cost. We needed a whole bunch of energy to build it, and we got that energy by burning fossil fuels, which came from dead plants and animals buried deep in the ground. We used up most of this fuel before you got here, and now it’s pretty much all gone. This means that we no longer have enough energy to keep our civilization running like it was before. So we’ve had to cut back. Big-time. We call this the Global Energy Crisis, and it’s been going on for a while now.  
  
  “Also, it turns out that burning all of those fossil fuels had some nasty side effects, like raising the temperature of our planet and screwing up the environment. So now the polar ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and the weather is all messed up. Plants and animals are dying off in record numbers, and lots of people are starving and homeless. And we’re still fighting wars with each other, mostly over the few resources we have left.  
  
  “Basically, kid, what this all means is that life is a lot tougher than it used to be, in the Good Old Days, back before you were born. Things used to be awesome, but now they’re kinda terrifying. To be honest, the future doesn’t look too bright. You were born at a pretty crappy time in history. And it looks like things are only gonna get worse from here on out. Human civilization is in ‘decline.’ Some people even say it’s ‘collapsing.’  
  
  “You’re probably wondering what’s going to happen to you. That’s easy. The same thing is going to happen to you that has happened to every other human being who has ever lived. You’re going to die. We all die. That’s just how it is.  
  
  “What happens when you die? Well, we’re not completely sure. But the evidence seems to suggest that nothing happens. You’re just dead, your brain stops working, and then you’re not around to ask annoying questions anymore. Those stories you heard? About going to a wonderful place called ‘heaven’ where there is no more pain or death and you live forever in a state of perpetual happiness? Also total bullshit. Just like all that God stuff. There’s no evidence of a heaven and there never was. We made that up too. Wishful thinking. So now you have to live the rest of your life knowing you’re going to die someday and disappear forever.  
  
  “Sorry.”  
  
  OK, on second thought, maybe honesty isn’t the best policy after all. Maybe it isn’t a good idea to tell a newly arrived human being that he’s been born into a world of chaos, pain, and poverty just in time to watch everything fall to pieces. I discovered all of that gradually over several years, and it still made me feel like jumping off a bridge.  
  
  Luckily, I had access to the OASIS, which was like having an escape hatch into a better reality. The OASIS kept me sane. It was my playground ",ConversationNo2446,NovelNexus,In-favor,Climate Change,"Ready Player One : Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the contest. I was sitting in my hideout watching cartoons when the news bulletin broke in on my video feed, announcing that James Halliday had died during the night....... Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the contest. I was sitting in my hideout watching cartoons when the news bulletin broke in on my video feed, announcing that James Halliday had died during the night. I’d heard of Halliday, of course. Everyone had. He was the videogame designer responsible for creating the OASIS, a massively multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved into the globally networked virtual reality most of humanity now used on a daily basis. The unprecedented success of the OASIS had made Halliday one of the wealthiest people in the world. At first, I couldn’t understand why the media was making such a big deal of the billionaire’s death. After all, the people of Planet Earth had other concerns. The ongoing energy crisis. Catastrophic climate change. Widespread famine, poverty, and disease. Half a dozen wars. You know: “dogs and cats living together … mass hysteria!” Normally, the newsfeeds didn’t interrupt everyone’s interactive sitcoms and soap operas unless something really major had happened. Like the outbreak of some new killer virus, or another major city vanishing in a mushroom cloud. Big stuff like that. As famous as he was, Halliday’s death should have warranted only a brief segment on the evening news, so the unwashed masses could shake their heads in envy when the newscasters announced the obscenely large amount of money that would be doled out to the rich man’s heirs.  But that was the rub. James Halliday had no heirs.  
He had died a sixty-seven-year-old bachelor, with no living relatives and, by most accounts, without a single friend. He’d spent the last fifteen years of his life in self-imposed isolation, during which time—if the rumors were to be believed—he’d gone completely insane. So the real jaw-dropping news that January morning, the news that had everyone from Toronto to Tokyo crapping in their cornflakes, concerned the contents of Halliday’s last will and testament, and the fate of his vast fortune.  
  
  Halliday had prepared a short video message, along with instructions that it be released to the world media at the time of his death. He’d also arranged to have a copy of the video e-mailed to every single OASIS user that same morning. I still remember hearing the familiar electronic chime when it arrived in my inbox, just a few seconds after I saw that first news bulletin.  
  
  His video message was actually a meticulously constructed short film titled Anorak’s Invitation. A famous eccentric, Halliday had harbored a lifelong obsession with the 1980s, the decade during which he’d been a teenager, and Anorak’s Invitation was crammed with obscure ’80s pop culture references, nearly all of which were lost on me the first time I viewed it.  
  
  The entire video was just over five minutes in length, and in the days and weeks that followed, it would become the most scrutinized piece of film in history, surpassing even the Zapruder film in the amount of painstaking frame-by-frame analysis devoted to it. My entire generation would come to know every second of Halliday’s message by heart.  
  
  Anorak’s Invitation begins with the sound of trumpets, the opening of an old song called “Dead Man’s Party.”  
  
  The song plays over a dark screen for the first few seconds, until the trumpets are joined by a guitar, and that’s when Halliday appears. But he’s not a sixty-seven-year-old man, ravaged by time and illness. He looks just as he did on the cover of Time magazine back in 2014, a tall, thin, healthy man in his early forties, with unkempt hair and his trademark horn-rimmed eyeglasses. He’s also wearing the same clothing he wore in the Time cover photo: faded jeans and a vintage Space Invaders T-shirt.  
  
  Halliday is at a high-school dance being held in a large gymnasium. He’s surrounded by teenagers whose clothing, hairstyles, and dance moves all indicate that the time period is the late 1980s.\* Halliday is dancing, too—something no one ever saw him do in real life. Grinning maniacally, he spins in rapid circles, swinging his arms and head in time with the song, flawlessly cycling through several signature ’80s dance moves. But Halliday has no dance partner. He is, as the saying goes, dancing with himself.  
  
  A few lines of text appear briefly at the lower left-hand corner of the screen, listing the name of the band, the song’s title, the record label, and the year of release, as if this were an old music video airing on MTV: Oingo Boingo, “Dead Man’s Party,” MCA Records, 1985.  
  
  When the lyrics kick in, Halliday begins to lip-synch along, still gyrating: “All dressed up with nowhere to go. Walking with a dead man over my shoulder. Don’t run away, it’s only me.…”  
  
  He abruptly stops dancing and makes a cutting motion with his right hand, silencing the music. At the same moment, the dancers and the gymnasium behind him vanish, and the scene around him suddenly changes.  
  
  Halliday now stands at the front of a funeral parlor, next to an open casket.† A second, much older Halliday lies inside the casket, his body emaciated and ravaged by cancer. Shiny quarters cover each of his eyelids.

The younger Halliday gazes down at the corpse of his older self with mock sadness, then turns to address the assembled mourners.§ Halliday snaps his fingers and a scroll appears in his right hand. He opens it with a flourish and it unfurls to the floor, unraveling down the aisle in front of him. He breaks the fourth wall, addressing the viewer, and begins to read.  
  
  “I, James Donovan Halliday, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby make, publish, and declare this instrument to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made.…” He continues reading, faster and faster, plowing through several more paragraphs of legalese, until he’s speaking so rapidly that the words are unintelligible. Then he stops abruptly. “Forget it,” he says. “Even at that speed, it would take me a month to read the whole thing. Sad to say, I don’t have that kind of time.” He drops the scroll and it vanishes in a shower of gold dust. “Let me just give you the highlights.”  
  
  The funeral parlor vanishes, and the scene changes once again. Halliday now stands in front of an immense bank vault door. “My entire estate, including a controlling share of stock in my company, Gregarious Simulation Systems, is to be placed in escrow until such time as a single condition I have set forth in my will is met. The first individual to meet that condition will inherit my entire fortune, currently valued in excess of two hundred and forty billion dollars.”  
  
  The vault door swings open and Halliday walks inside. The interior of the vault is enormous, and it contains a huge stack of gold bars, roughly the size of a large house. “Here’s the dough I’m putting up for grabs,” Halliday says, grinning broadly. “What the hell. You can’t take it with you, right?”  
  
  Halliday leans against the stack of gold bars, and the camera pulls in tight on his face. “Now, I’m sure you’re wondering, what do you have to do to get your hands on all this moolah? Well, hold your horses, kids. I’m getting to that.…” He pauses dramatically, his expression changing to that of a child about to reveal a very big secret.  
  
  Halliday snaps his fingers again and the vault disappears. In the same instant, Halliday shrinks and morphs into a small boy wearing brown corduroys and a faded The Muppet Show T-shirt.\* The young Halliday stands in a cluttered living room with burnt orange carpeting, wood-paneled walls, and kitschy late-’70s decor. A 21-inch Zenith television sits nearby, with an Atari 2600 game console hooked up to it.  
  
  “This was the first videogame system I ever owned,” Halliday says, now in a child’s voice. “An Atari 2600. I got it for Christmas in 1979.” He plops down in front of the Atari, picks up a joystick, and begins to play. “My favorite game was this one,” he says, nodding at the TV screen, where a small square is traveling through a series of simple mazes. “It was called Adventure. Like many early videogames, Adventure was designed and programmed by just one person. But back then, Atari refused to give its programmers credit for their work, so the name of a game’s creator didn’t actually appear anywhere on the packaging.” On the TV screen, we see Halliday use a sword to slay a red dragon, although due to the game’s crude low-resolution graphics, this looks more like a square using an arrow to stab a deformed duck.  
  
  “So the guy who created Adventure, a man named Warren Robinett, decided to hide his name inside the game itself. He hid a key in one of the game’s labyrinths. If you found this key, a small pixel-sized gray dot, you could use it to enter a secret room where Robinett had hidden his name.” On the TV, Halliday guides his square protagonist into the game’s secret room, where the words CREATED BY WARREN ROBINETT appear in the center of the screen.  
  
  “This,” Halliday says, pointing to the screen with genuine reverence, “was the very first videogame Easter egg. Robinett hid it in his game’s code without telling a soul, and Atari manufactured and shipped Adventure all over the world without knowing about the secret room. They didn’t find out about the Easter egg’s existence until a few months later, when kids all over the world began to discover it. I was one of those kids, and finding Robinett’s Easter egg for the first time was one of the coolest videogaming experiences of my life.”  
  
  The young Halliday drops his joystick and stands. As he does, the living room fades away, and the scene shifts again. Halliday now stands in a dim cavern, where light from unseen torches flickers off the damp walls. In the same instant, Halliday’s appearance also changes once again, as he morphs into his famous OASIS avatar, Anorak—a tall, robed wizard with a slightly more handsome version of the adult Halliday’s face (minus the eyeglasses). Anorak is dressed in his trademark black robes, with his avatar’s emblem (a large calligraphic letter “A”) embroidered on each sleeve.  
  
  “Before I died,” Anorak says, speaking in a much deeper voice, “I created my own Easter egg, and hid it somewhere inside my most popular videogame—the OASIS. The first person to find my Easter egg will inherit my entire fortune.”  
  
  Another dramatic pause.  
  
  “The egg is well hidden. I didn’t just leave it lying under a rock somewhere. I suppose you could say that it’s locked inside a safe that is buried in a secret room that lies hidden at the center of a maze located somewhere”—he reaches up to tap his right temple—“up here.  
  
  “But don’t worry. I’ve left a few clues lying around to get everyone started. And here’s the first one.” Anorak makes a grand gesture with his right hand, and three keys appear, spinning slowly in the air in front of him. They appear to be made of copper, jade, and clear crystal. As the keys continue to spin, Anorak recites a piece of verse, and as he speaks each line, it appears briefly in flaming subtitles across the bottom of screen:  
  
  Three hidden keys open three secret gates  
  
  Wherein the errant will be tested for worthy traits  
  
  And those with the skill to survive these straits  
  
  Will reach The End where the prize awaits  
  
  As he finishes, the jade and crystal keys vanish, leaving only the copper key, which now hangs on a chain around Anorak’s neck.  
  
  The camera follows Anorak as he turns and continues farther into the dark cavern. A few seconds later, he arrives at a pair of massive wooden doors set into the cavern’s rocky wall. These doors are banded with steel, and there are shields and dragons carved into their surfaces. “I couldn’t playtest this particular game, so I worry that I may have hidden my Easter egg a little too well. Made it too difficult to reach. I’m not sure. If that’s the case, it’s too late to change anything now. So I guess we’ll see.”  
  
  Anorak throws open the double doors, revealing an immense treasure room filled with piles of glittering gold coins and jewel-encrusted goblets.\* Then he steps into the open doorway and turns to face the viewer, stretching out his arms to hold open the giant double doors.†  
  
  “So without further ado,” Anorak announces, “let the hunt for Halliday’s Easter egg begin!” Then he vanishes in a flash of light, leaving the viewer to gaze through the open doorway at the glittering mounds of treasure that lay beyond.  
  
  Then the screen fades to black.  
  
  At the end of the video, Halliday included a link to his personal website, which had changed drastically on the morning of his death. For over a decade, the only thing posted there had been a short looping animation that showed his avatar, Anorak, sitting in a medieval library, hunched over a scarred worktable, mixing potions and poring over dusty spellbooks, with a large painting of a black dragon visible on the wall behind him.  
  
  But now that animation was gone, and in its place there was a high-score list like those that used to appear in old coin-operated videogames. The list had ten numbered spots, and each displayed the initials JDH—James Donovan Halliday—followed by a score of six zeros. This high-score list quickly came to be known as “the Scoreboard.”  
  
  Just below the Scoreboard was an icon that looked like a small leather-bound book, which linked to a free downloadable copy of Anorak’s Almanac, a collection of hundreds of Halliday’s undated journal entries. The Almanac was over a thousand pages long, but it co  
ntained few details about Halliday’s personal life or his day-to-day activities. Most of the entries were his stream-of-consciousness observations on various classic videogames, science-fiction and fantasy novels, movies, comic books, and ’80s pop culture, mixed with humorous diatribes denouncing everything from organized religion to diet soda.  
  
  The Hunt, as the contest came to be known, quickly wove its way into global culture. Like winning the lottery, finding Halliday’s Easter egg became a popular fantasy among adults and children alike. It was a game anyone could play, and at first, there seemed to be no right or wrong way to play it. The only thing Anorak’s Almanac seemed to indicate was that a familiarity with Halliday’s various obsessions would be essential to finding the egg. This led to a global fascination with 1980s pop culture. Fifty years after the decade had ended, the movies, music, games, and fashions of the 1980s were all the rage once again. By 2041, spiked hair and acid-washed jeans were back in style, and covers of hit ’80s pop songs by contemporary bands dominated the music charts. People who had actually been teenagers in the 1980s, all now approaching old age, had the strange experience of seeing the fads and fashions of their youth embraced and studied by their grandchildren.  
  
  A new subculture was born, composed of the millions of people who now devoted every free moment of their lives to searching for Halliday’s egg. At first, these individuals were known simply as “egg hunters,” but this was quickly truncated to the nickname “gunters.”  
  
  During the first year of the Hunt, being a gunter was highly fashionable, and nearly every OASIS user claimed to be one.  
  
  When the first anniversary of Halliday’s death arrived, the fervor surrounding the contest began to die down. An entire year had passed and no one had found anything. Not a single key or gate. Part of the problem was the sheer size of the OASIS. It contained thousands of simulated worlds where the keys might be hidden, and it could take a gunter years to conduct a thorough search of any one of them.  
  
  Despite all of the “professional” gunters who boasted on their blogs that they were getting closer to a breakthrough every day, the truth gradually became apparent: No one really even knew exactly what it was they were looking for, or where to start looking for it.  
  
  Another year passed.  
  
  And another.  
  
  Still nothing.  
  
  The general public lost all interest in the contest. People began to assume it was all just an outlandish hoax perpetrated by a rich nut job. Others believed that even if the egg really did exist, no one was ever going to find it. Meanwhile, the OASIS continued to evolve and grow in popularity, protected from takeover attempts and legal challenges by the ironclad terms of Halliday’s will and the army of rabid lawyers he had tasked with administering his estate.  
  
  Halliday’s Easter egg gradually moved into the realm of urban legend, and the ever-dwindling tribe of gunters gradually became the object of ridicule. Each year, on the anniversary of Halliday’s death, newscasters jokingly reported on their continued lack of progress. And each year, more gunters called it quits, concluding that Halliday had indeed made the egg impossible to find.  
  
  And another year went by.  
  
  And another.  
  
  Then, on the evening of February 11, 2045, an avatar’s name appeared at the top of the Scoreboard, for the whole world to see. After five long years, the Copper Key had finally been found, by an eighteen-year-old kid living in a trailer park on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.  
  
  That kid was me.  
  
  Dozens of books, cartoons, movies, and miniseries have attempted to tell the story of everything that happened next, but every single one of them got it wrong. So I want to set the record straight, once and for all.  
  
  \* Careful analysis of this scene reveals that all of the teenagers behind Halliday are actually extras from various John Hughes teen films who have been digitally cut-and-pasted into the video.  
  
  † His surroundings are actually from a scene in the 1989 film Heathers. Halliday appears to have digitally re-created the funeral parlor set and then inserted himself into it.  
  
  ‡ High-resolution scrutiny reveals that both quarters were minted in 1984.  
  
  § The mourners are actually all actors and extras from the same funeral scene in Heathers. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater are clearly visible in the audience, sitting near the back.  
  
  \* Halliday now looks exactly as he did in a school photo taken in 1980, when he was eight years old.  
  
  \* Analysis reveals dozens of curious items hidden among the mounds of treasure, most notably: several early home computers (an Apple IIe, a Commodore 64, an Atari 800XL, and a TRS-80 Color Computer 2), dozens of videogame controllers for a variety of game systems, and hundreds of polyhedral dice like those used in old tabletop role-playing games.  
  
  † A freeze-frame of this scene appears nearly identical to a painting by Jeff Easley that appeared on the cover of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, a Dungeons & Dragons rulebook published in 1983.  
  
  Being human totally sucks most of the time.  
  
  Videogames are the only thing that  
  
  make life bearable.

  I was jolted awake by the sound of gunfire in one of the neighboring stacks. The shots were followed by a few minutes of muffled shouting and screaming, then silence.  
  
  Gunfire wasn’t uncommon in the stacks, but it still shook me up. I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep, so I decided to kill the remaining hours until dawn by brushing up on a few coin-op classics. Galaga, Defender, Asteroids. These games were outdated digital dinosaurs that had become museum pieces long before I was born. But I was a gunter, so I didn’t think of them as quaint low-res antiques. To me, they were hallowed artifacts. Pillars of the pantheon. When I played the classics, I did so with a determined sort of reverence.  
  
  I was curled up in an old sleeping bag in the corner of the trailer’s tiny laundry room, wedged into the gap between the wall and the dryer. I wasn’t welcome in my aunt’s room across the hall, which was fine by me. I preferred to crash in the laundry room anyway. It was warm, it afforded me a limited amount of privacy, and the wireless reception wasn’t too bad. And, as an added bonus, the room smelled like liquid detergent and fabric softener. The rest of the trailer reeked of cat piss and abject poverty.  
  
  Most of the time I slept in my hideout. But the temperature had dropped below zero the past few nights, and as much as I hated staying at my aunt’s place, it still beat freezing to death.  
  
  A total of fifteen people lived in my aunt’s trailer. She slept in the smallest of its three bedrooms. The Depperts lived in the bedroom adjacent to hers, and the Millers occupied the large master bedroom at the end of the hall. There were six of them, and they paid the largest share of the rent. Our trailer wasn’t as crowded as some of the other units in the stacks. It was a double-wide. Plenty of room for everybody.  
  
  I pulled out my laptop and powered it on. It was a bulky, heavy beast, almost ten years old. I’d found it in a trash bin behind the abandoned strip mall across the highway. I’d been able to coax it back to life by replacing its system memory and reloading the stone-age operating system. The processor was slower than a sloth by current standards, but it was fine for my needs. The laptop served as my portable research library, video arcade, and home theater system. Its hard drive was filled with old books, movies, TV show episodes, song files, and nearly every videogame made in the twentieth century.  
  
  I booted up my emulator and selected Robotron: 2084, one of my all-time favorite games. I’d always loved its frenetic pace and brutal simplicity. Robotron was all about instinct and reflexes. Playing old videogames never failed to clear my mind and set me at ease. If I was feeling depressed or frustrated about my lot in life, all I had to do was tap the Player One button, and my worries would instantly slip away as my mind focused itself on the relentless pixelated onslaught on the screen in front of me. There, inside the game’s two-dimensional universe, life was simple: It’s just you against the machin  
e. Move with your left hand, shoot with your right, and try to stay alive as long as possible.  
  
  I spent a few hours blasting through wave after wave of Brains, Spheroids, Quarks, and Hulks in my unending battle to Save the Last Human Family! But eventually my fingers started to cramp up and I began to lose my rhythm. When that happened at this level, things deteriorated quickly. I burned through all of my extra lives in a matter of minutes, and my two least-favorite words appeared on the screen: GAME OVER.  
  
  I shut down the emulator and began to browse through my video files. Over the past five years, I’d downloaded every single movie, TV show, and cartoon mentioned in Anorak’s Almanac. I still hadn’t watched all of them yet, of course. That would probably take decades.  
  
  I selected an episode of Family Ties, an ’80s sitcom about a middleclass family living in central Ohio. I’d downloaded the show because it had been one of Halliday’s favorites, and I figured there was a chance that some clue related to the Hunt might be hidden in one of the episodes. I’d become addicted to the show immediately, and had now watched all 180 episodes, multiple times. I never seemed to get tired of them.  
  
  Sitting alone in the dark, watching the show on my laptop, I always found myself imagining that I lived in that warm, well-lit house, and that those smiling, understanding people were my family. That there was nothing so wrong in the world that we couldn’t sort it out by the end of a single half-hour episode (or maybe a two-parter, if it was something really serious).  
  
  My own home life had never even remotely resembled the one depicted in Family Ties, which was probably why I loved the show so much. I was the only child of two teenagers, both refugees who’d met in the stacks where I’d grown up. I don’t remember my father. When I was just a few months old, he was shot dead while looting a grocery store during a power blackout. The only thing I really knew about him was that he loved comic books. I’d found several old flash drives in a box of his things, containing complete runs of The Amazing Spider-Man, The X-Men, and Green Lantern. My mom once told me that my dad had given me an alliterative name, Wade Watts, because he thought it sounded like the secret identity of a superhero. Like Peter Parker or Clark Kent. Knowing that made me think he must have been a cool guy, despite how he’d died.  
  
  My mother, Loretta, had raised me on her own. We’d lived in a small RV in another part of the stacks. She had two full-time OASIS jobs, one as a telemarketer, the other as an escort in an online brothel. She used to make me wear earplugs at night so I wouldn’t hear her in the next room, talking dirty to tricks in other time zones. But the earplugs didn’t work very well, so I would watch old movies instead, with the volume turned way up.  
  
  I was introduced to the OASIS at an early age, because my mother used it as a virtual babysitter. As soon as I was old enough to wear a visor and a pair of haptic gloves, my mom helped me create my first OASIS avatar. Then she stuck me in a corner and went back to work, leaving me to explore an entirely new world, very different from the one I’d known up until then.  
  
  From that moment on, I was more or less raised by the OASIS’s interactive educational programs, which any kid could access for free. I spent a big chunk of my childhood hanging out in a virtual-reality simulation of Sesame Street, singing songs with friendly Muppets and playing interactive games that taught me how to walk, talk, add, subtract, read, write, and share. Once I’d mastered those skills, it didn’t take me long to discover that the OASIS was also the world’s biggest public library, where even a penniless kid like me had access to every book ever written, every song ever recorded, and every movie, television show, videogame, and piece of artwork ever created. The collected knowledge, art, and amusements of all human civilization were there, waiting for me. But gaining access to all of that information turned out to be something of a mixed blessing. Because that was when I found out the truth.  
  
  I don’t know, maybe your experience differed from mine. For me, growing up as a human being on the planet Earth in the twenty-first century was a real kick in the teeth. Existentially speaking.  
  
  The worst thing about being a kid was that no one told me the truth about my situation. In fact, they did the exact opposite. And, of course, I believed them, because I was just a kid and I didn’t know any better. I mean, Christ, my brain hadn’t even grown to full size yet, so how could I be expected to know when the adults were bullshitting me?  
  
  So I swallowed all of the dark ages nonsense they fed me. Some time passed. I grew up a little, and I gradually began to figure out that pretty much everyone had been lying to me about pretty much everything since the moment I emerged from my mother’s womb.  
  
  This was an alarming revelation.  
  
  It gave me trust issues later in life.  
  
  I started to figure out the ugly truth as soon as I began to explore the free OASIS libraries. The facts were right there waiting for me, hidden in old books written by people who weren’t afraid to be honest. Artists and scientists and philosophers and poets, many of them long dead. As I read the words they’d left behind, I finally began to get a grip on the situation. My situation. Our situation. What most people referred to as “the human condition.”  
  
  It was not good news.  
  
  I wish someone had just told me the truth right up front, as soon as I was old enough to understand it. I wish someone had just said:  
  
  “Here’s the deal, Wade. You’re something called a ‘human being.’ That’s a really smart kind of animal. Like every other animal on this planet, we’re descended from a single-celled organism that lived millions of years ago. This happened by a process called evolution, and you’ll learn more about it later. But trust me, that’s really how we all got here. There’s proof of it everywhere, buried in the rocks. That story you heard? About how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named God who lives up in the sky? Total bullshit. The whole God thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that people have been telling one another for thousands of years. We made it all up. Like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.  
  
  “Oh, and by the way … there’s no Santa Claus or Easter Bunny. Also bullshit. Sorry, kid. Deal with it.  
  
  “You’re probably wondering what happened before you got here. An awful lot of stuff, actually. Once we evolved into humans, things got pretty interesting. We figured out how to grow food and domesticate animals so we didn’t have to spend all of our time hunting. Our tribes got much bigger, and we spread across the entire planet like an unstoppable virus. Then, after fighting a bunch of wars with each other over land, resources, and our made-up gods, we eventually got all of our tribes organized into a ‘global civilization.’ But, honestly, it wasn’t all that organized, or civilized, and we continued to fight a lot of wars with each other. But we also figured out how to do science, which helped us develop technology. For a bunch of hairless apes, we’ve actually managed to invent some pretty incredible things. Computers. Medicine. Lasers. Microwave ovens. Artificial hearts. Atomic bombs. We even sent a few guys to the moon and brought them back. We also created a global communications network that lets us all talk to each other, all around the world, all the time. Pretty impressive, right?  
  
  “But that’s where the bad news comes in. Our global civilization came at a huge cost. We needed a whole bunch of energy to build it, and we got that energy by burning fossil fuels, which came from dead plants and animals buried deep in the ground. We used up most of this fuel before you got here, and now it’s pretty much all gone. This means that we no longer have enough energy to keep our civilization running like it was before. So we’ve had to cut back. Big-time. We call this the Global Energy Crisis, and it’s been going on for a while now.  
  
  “Also, it turns out that burning all of those fossil fuels had some nasty side effects, like raising the temperature of our planet and screwing up the environment. So now the polar ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and the weather is all messed up. Plants and animals are dying off in record numbers, and lots of people are starving and homeless. And we’re still fighting wars with each other, mostly over the few resources we have left.  
  
  “Basically, kid, what this all means is that life is a lot tougher than it used to be, in the Good Old Days, back before you were born. Things used to be awesome, but now they’re kinda terrifying. To be honest, the future doesn’t look too bright. You were born at a pretty crappy time in history. And it looks like things are only gonna get worse from here on out. Human civilization is in ‘decline.’ Some people even say it’s ‘collapsing.’  
  
  “You’re probably wondering what’s going to happen to you. That’s easy. The same thing is going to happen to you that has happened to every other human being who has ever lived. You’re going to die. We all die. That’s just how it is.  
  
  “What happens when you die? Well, we’re not completely sure. But the evidence seems to suggest that nothing happens. You’re just dead, your brain stops working, and then you’re not around to ask annoying questions anymore. Those stories you heard? About going to a wonderful place called ‘heaven’ where there is no more pain or death and you live forever in a state of perpetual happiness? Also total bullshit. Just like all that God stuff. There’s no evidence of a heaven and there never was. We made that up too. Wishful thinking. So now you have to live the rest of your life knowing you’re going to die someday and disappear forever.  
  
  “Sorry.”  
  
  OK, on second thought, maybe honesty isn’t the best policy after all. Maybe it isn’t a good idea to tell a newly arrived human being that he’s been born into a world of chaos, pain, and poverty just in time to wat","player one : everyone my age remembers where they were

rub . james halliday had no heirs . he had a sixty-seven-year-old bachelor , with no living relatives and , by most accounts , without a single friend . he ’ d spent the last fifteen years of his life

my inbox , just a few seconds after i saw that first news bulletin . his video message was actually a constructed short film titled anorak ’ s invitation . a , halliday had harbored a lifelong with the 1980s , the decade during which he ’ d been a teenager , and anorak ’ s invitation was crammed with ’ 80s pop culture references , nearly all of which were on me the first time i viewed it . the entire video was just over five minutes in length , and in the days and weeks that followed , it would become the most scrutinized piece of film in history , surpassing even the zapruder film in the amount of painstaking frame-by-frame analysis devoted to it . my entire generation would come to know every second of halliday ’ s message by heart . anorak ’ s invitation begins with the sound of trumpets , the opening of an old song called “ man ’ s party. ” the song plays over a screen for the first few seconds , until the trumpets are joined by a guitar , and that ’ s when halliday appears . but he ’ s not a sixty-seven-year-old man , ravaged by time and . he looks just as he did on the cover of time magazine back in 2014 , a tall , thin , man in his early forties , with unkempt hair and his trademark horn-rimmed eyeglasses . he ’ s also wearing the same clothing he wore in the time cover photo : faded jeans and a vintage space invaders t-shirt . halliday is at a high-school dance being held in a large gymnasium . he ’ s surrounded by teenagers whose clothing , hairstyles , and dance moves all indicate that the time period is the late 1980s.\ * halliday is dancing , too—something no one ever saw him do in real life . grinning maniacally , he spins in circles , swinging his arms and head in time with the song , cycling through several signature ’ 80s dance moves . but halliday has no dance partner . he is , as the saying goes , dancing with himself . a few lines of text appear briefly at the lower left-hand corner of the screen , listing the name of the band , the song ’ s title , the record label , and the year of release , as if this were an old music video airing on mtv : oingo boingo , “ man ’ s party , ” mca records , 1985. when the lyrics kick in , halliday begins to lip-synch along , still gyrating : “ all dressed up with nowhere to go . walking with a man over my shoulder . don ’ t run away , it ’ s only me.… ” he stops dancing and makes a cutting motion with his hand , silencing the music . at the same moment , the dancers and the gymnasium behind him vanish , and the scene around him suddenly changes . halliday now stands at the front of a funeral parlor , next to an open casket.† a second , much older halliday inside the casket , his body and ravaged by . quarters cover each of his eyelids . the younger halliday gazes down at the corpse of his older self with , then turns to address the assembled mourners.§ halliday snaps his fingers and a scroll appears in his hand . he opens it with a and it unfurls to the floor , unraveling down the aisle in front of him . he the fourth wall , addressing the viewer , and begins to read . “ i , james donovan halliday , being of sound mind and disposing memory , do hereby make , publish , and declare this instrument to be my last will and testament , hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made.… ” he continues reading , and , plowing through several more paragraphs of legalese , until he ’ s speaking so rapidly that the words are . then he stops . “ forget it , ” he says . “ even at that speed , it would take me a month to read the whole thing . to say , i don ’ t have that kind of time. ” he drops the scroll and it vanishes in a shower of . “ let me just give you the highlights. ” the funeral parlor vanishes , and the scene changes once again . halliday now stands in front of an bank vault door . “ my entire estate , including a controlling share of stock in my company , gregarious simulation systems , is to be placed in escrow until such time as a single condition i have set forth in my will is met . the first individual to meet that condition will inherit my entire , currently valued in excess of two hundred and forty billion dollars. ” the vault door swings open and halliday walks inside . the interior of the vault is enormous , and it contains a huge stack of bars , roughly the size of a large house . “ here ’ s the dough i ’ m putting up for grabs , ” halliday says , grinning broadly . “ what the . you can ’ t take it with you , ? ” halliday leans against the stack of bars , and the camera pulls in tight on his face . “ now , i ’ m sure you ’ re wondering , what do you have to do to get your hands on all this moolah ? , hold your horses , kids . i ’ m getting to that.… ” he pauses dramatically , his expression changing to that of a child about to reveal a very big secret . halliday snaps his fingers again and the vault disappears . in the same instant , halliday shrinks and morphs into a small boy wearing brown corduroys and a faded the muppet show t-shirt.\ * the young halliday stands in a cluttered living room with burnt orange carpeting , wood-paneled walls , and kitschy late- ’ 70s decor . a 21-inch television sits nearby , with an atari 2600 game console hooked up to it . “ this was the first videogame system i ever owned , ” halliday says , now in a child ’ s voice . “ an atari 2600. i got it for christmas in 1979. ” he plops down in front of the atari , picks up a joystick , and begins to play . “ my game was this one , ” he says , nodding at the tv screen , where a small square is traveling through a series of simple mazes . “ it was called adventure . many early videogames , adventure was designed and programmed by just one person . but back then , atari to give its programmers credit for their , so the name of a game ’ s creator didn ’ t actually appear anywhere on the packaging. ” on the tv screen , we see halliday use a sword to slay a red dragon , although due to the game ’ s low-resolution graphics , this looks more a square using an arrow to a duck . “ so the guy who created adventure , a man named warren robinett , decided to hide his name inside the game itself . he hid a key in one of the game ’ s labyrinths . if you found this key , a small pixel-sized gray dot , you could use it to enter a secret room where robinett had hidden his name. ” on the tv , halliday guides his square protagonist into the game ’ s secret room , where the words created by warren robinett appear in the center of the screen . “ this , ” halliday says , pointing to the screen with , “ was the very first videogame easter egg . robinett hid it in his game ’ s code without telling a soul , and atari manufactured and shipped adventure all over the world without knowing about the secret room . they didn ’ t find out about the easter egg ’ s existence until a few months later , when kids all over the world began to discover it . i was one of those kids , and finding robinett ’ s easter egg for the first time was one of the videogaming experiences of my life. ” the young halliday drops his joystick and stands . as he does , the living room fades away , and the scene shifts again . halliday now stands in a cavern , where light from unseen torches off the damp walls . in the same instant , halliday ’ s appearance also changes once again , as he morphs into his avatar , anorak—a tall , robed wizard with a slightly more version of the adult halliday ’ s face ( minus the eyeglasses ) . anorak is dressed in his trademark black robes , with his avatar ’ s emblem ( a large calligraphic letter “ a ” ) embroidered on each sleeve . “ before i , ” anorak says , speaking in a much deeper voice , “ i created my own easter egg , and hid it somewhere inside my most videogame—the . the first person to find my easter egg will inherit my entire fortune. ” another dramatic pause . “ the egg is hidden . i didn ’ t just leave it under a rock somewhere . i suppose you could say that it ’ s locked inside a that is buried in a secret room that hidden at the center of a maze located somewhere ” —he reaches up to tap his temple— “ up here . “ but don ’ t . i ’ ve left a few clues around to get everyone started . and here ’ s the first one. ” anorak makes a gesture with his hand , and three keys appear , spinning in the air in front of him . they appear to be made of copper , jade , and crystal . as the keys continue to spin , anorak recites a piece of verse , and as he speaks each line , it appears briefly in flaming subtitles across the bottom of screen : three hidden keys open three secret gates wherein the will be tested for traits and those with the to survive these straits will reach the end where the awaits as he finishes , the jade and crystal keys vanish , leaving only the copper key , which now on a chain around anorak ’ s neck . the camera follows anorak as he turns and continues farther into the cavern . a few seconds later , he arrives at a pair of massive wooden doors set into the cavern ’ s wall . these doors are banded with steel , and there are shields and dragons carved into their surfaces . “ i couldn ’ t playtest this particular game , so i that i may have hidden my easter egg a little too . made it too to reach . i ’ m not sure . if that ’ s the case , it ’ s too late to change anything now . so i guess we ’ ll see. ” anorak throws open the double doors , revealing an room filled with piles of glittering coins and jewel-encrusted goblets.\ * then he steps into the open doorway and turns to face the viewer , stretching out his arms to hold open the giant double doors.† “ so without further ado , ” anorak announces , “ let the hunt for halliday ’ s easter egg begin ! ” then he vanishes in a flash of light , leaving the viewer to gaze through the open doorway at the glittering mounds of that lay beyond . then the screen fades to black . at the end of the video , halliday included a link to his personal website , which had changed on the morning of his . for over a decade , the only thing posted there had been a short looping animation that showed his avatar , anorak , sitting in a medieval library , hunched over a worktable , mixing potions and poring over spellbooks , with a large painting of a black dragon visible on the wall behind him . but now that animation was gone , and in its place there was a high-score list those that used to appear in old coin-operated videogames . the list had ten numbered spots , and each displayed the initials jdh—james donovan halliday—followed by a score of six zeros . this high-score list quickly came to be known as “ the scoreboard. ” just below the scoreboard was an icon that looked a small leather-bound book , which linked to a downloadable copy of anorak ’ s almanac , a collection of hundreds of halliday ’ s undated journal entries . the almanac was over a thousand pages long , but it co ntained few details about halliday ’ s personal life or his day-to-day activities . most of the entries were his stream-of-consciousness observations on various videogames , science-fiction and fantasy novels , movies , comic books , and ’ 80s pop culture , mixed with denouncing everything from organized religion to diet soda . the hunt , as the contest came to be known , quickly wove its way into global culture . the lottery , finding halliday ’ s easter egg became a fantasy among adults and children alike . it was a game anyone could play , and at first , there seemed to be no or way to play it . the only thing anorak ’ s almanac seemed to indicate was that a familiarity with halliday ’ s various would be essential to finding the egg . this to a global with 1980s pop culture . fifty years after the decade had ended , the movies , music , games , and fashions of the 1980s were all the once again . by 2041 , spiked hair and acid-washed jeans were back in style , and covers of hit ’ 80s pop songs by contemporary bands the music charts . people who had actually been teenagers in the 1980s , all now approaching old age , had the experience of seeing the fads and fashions of their youth embraced and studied by their grandchildren . a new subculture was born , composed of the millions of people who now devoted every moment of their lives to searching for halliday ’ s egg . at first , these individuals were known simply as “ egg hunters , ” but this was quickly truncated to the nickname “ gunters. ” during the first year of the hunt , being a gunter was highly , and nearly every user claimed to be one . when the first anniversary of halliday ’ s arrived , the surrounding the contest began to down . an entire year had passed and no one had found anything . not a single key or gate . part of the was the sheer size of the . it contained thousands of simulated worlds where the keys might be hidden , and it could take a gunter years to conduct a thorough search of any one of them . despite all of the “ professional ” gunters who boasted on their blogs that they were getting closer to a every day , the truth gradually became apparent : no one really even knew exactly what it was they were looking for , or where to start looking for it . another year passed . and another . still nothing . the general public all interest in the contest . people began to assume it was all just an outlandish perpetrated by a nut job . others believed that even if the egg really did exist , no one was ever going to find it . meanwhile , the continued to evolve and grow in popularity , protected from takeover attempts and legal challenges by the ironclad terms of halliday ’ s will and the army of lawyers he had tasked with administering his estate . halliday ’ s easter egg gradually

watching the show on my laptop , i always found myself imagining that i lived in that , well-lit house , and that those , understanding people were my family . that there was nothing so in the world

depicted in family ties , which was probably why i the show so much . i was the only child of two teenagers , both refugees who ’ d met in the stacks where i ’ d grown up . i don ’ t remember my father . when i was just a few months old , he was shot while looting a grocery store during a power blackout . the only thing i really knew about him was that he comic books . i ’ d found several old flash drives in a box of his things , containing complete runs of the spider-man , the x-men , and green lantern . my mom once told me that my dad had given me an alliterative name , wade watts , because he thought it sounded the secret identity of a superhero . peter parker or clark kent . knowing that made me think he must have been a guy , despite how he ’ d . my mother , loretta , had raised me on her own . we ’ d lived in a small rv in another part of the stacks . she had two full-time jobs , one as a telemarketer , the other as an escort in an online brothel . she used to make me wear earplugs at night so i wouldn ’ t hear her in the next room , talking to tricks in other time zones . but the earplugs didn ’ t very , so i would watch old movies instead , with the volume turned way up . i was introduced to the at an early age , because my mother used it as a virtual babysitter . as soon as i was old to wear a visor and a pair of haptic gloves , my mom me create my first avatar . then she me in a corner and went back to , leaving me to explore an entirely new world , very different from the one i ’ d known up until then . from that moment on , i was more or less raised by the ’ s interactive educational programs , which any kid could access for . i spent a big chunk of my childhood hanging out in a virtual-reality simulation of sesame street , singing songs with muppets and playing interactive games that taught me how to walk , talk , add , , read , write , and share . once i ’ d mastered those skills , it didn ’ t take me long to discover that the was also the world ’ s biggest public library , where even a penniless kid me had access to every book ever written , every song ever recorded , and every movie , television show , videogame , and piece of artwork ever created . the collected knowledge , art , and amusements of all human civilization were there , waiting for me . but access to all of that information turned out to be something of a mixed . because that was when i found out the truth . i don ’ t know , maybe your experience differed from mine . for me , growing up as a human being on the planet earth in the twenty-first century was a real kick in the teeth . existentially speaking . the thing about being a kid was that no one told me the truth about my situation . in fact , they did the exact opposite . and , of course , i believed them , because i was just a kid and i didn ’ t know any . i mean , christ , my brain hadn ’ t even grown to full size yet , so how could i be expected to know when the adults were bullshitting me ? so i swallowed all of the ages they fed me . some time passed . i grew up a little , and i gradually began to figure out that much everyone had been to me about much everything since the moment i emerged from my mother ’ s womb . this was an . it gave me later in life . i started to figure out the truth as soon as i began to explore the libraries . the facts were there waiting for me , hidden in old books written by people who weren ’ t to be . artists and scientists and philosophers and poets , many of them long . as i read the words they ’ d left behind , i finally began to get a grip on the situation . my situation . our situation . what most people referred to as “ the human condition. ” it was not news . i wish someone had just told me the truth up front , as soon as i was old to understand it . i wish someone had just said : “ here ’ s the deal , wade . you ’ re something called a ‘ human being. ’ that ’ s a really kind of animal . every other animal on this planet , we ’ re descended from a single-celled organism that lived millions of years ago . this happened by a process called evolution , and you ’ ll learn more about it later . but me , that ’ s really how we all got here . there ’ s proof of it everywhere , buried in the rocks . that story you heard ? about how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named god who lives up in the sky ? total . the whole god thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that people have been telling one another for thousands of years . we made it all up . santa claus and the easter bunny . “ oh , and by the way … there ’ s no santa claus or easter bunny . also . , kid . deal with it . “ you ’ re probably wondering what happened before you got here . an lot of stuff , actually . once we evolved into humans , things got . we figured out how to grow food and domesticate animals so we didn ’ t have to spend all of our time hunting . our tribes got much bigger , and we spread across the entire planet an unstoppable . then , after fighting a bunch of wars with each other over land , resources , and our made-up gods , we eventually got all of our tribes organized into a ‘ global civilization. ’ but , honestly , it wasn ’ t all that organized , or civilized , and we continued to fight a lot of wars with each other . but we also figured out how to do science , which us develop technology . for a bunch of hairless apes , we ’ ve actually managed to invent some things . computers . medicine . lasers . microwave ovens . artificial hearts . atomic bombs . we even sent a few guys to the moon and brought them back . we also created a global communications network that lets us all talk to each other , all around the world , all the time . , ? “ but that ’ s where the news comes in . our global civilization came at a huge cost . we needed a whole bunch of energy to build it , and we got that energy by fossil fuels , which came from plants and animals buried deep in the ground . we used up most of this fuel before you got here , and now it ’ s much all gone . this means that we no longer have energy to keep our civilization running it was before . so we ’ ve had to cut back . big-time . we call this the global energy , and it ’ s been going on for a while now . “ also , it turns out that all of those fossil fuels had some side effects , raising the temperature of our planet and screwing up the environment . so now the polar ice caps are melting , sea levels are rising , and the weather is all up . plants and animals are off in record numbers , and lots of people are starving and homeless . and we ’ re still fighting wars with each other , mostly over the few resources we have left . “ basically , kid , what this all means is that life is a lot than it used to be , in the old days , back before you were born . things used to be , but now they ’ re kinda terrifying . to be , the future doesn ’ t look too . you were born at a time in history . and it looks things are only gon na get from here on out . human civilization is in ‘ decline. ’ some people even say it ’ s ‘ collapsing. ’ “ you ’ re probably wondering what ’ s going to happen to you . that ’ s . the same thing is going to happen to you that has happened to every other human being who has ever lived . you ’ re going to . we all . that ’ s just how it is . “ what happens when you ? , we ’ re not completely sure . but the evidence seems to suggest that nothing happens . you ’ re just , your brain stops working , and then you ’ re not around to ask questions anymore . those stories you heard ? about going to a place called ‘ ’ where there is no more or and you live forever in a state of perpetual ? also total . just all that god stuff . there ’ s no evidence of a and there never was . we made that up too . wishful thinking . so now you have to live the rest of your life knowing you ’ re going to someday and disappear forever . “ sorry. ” ok , on second thought , maybe isn ’ t the policy after all . maybe it isn ’ t a idea to tell a newly arrived human being that he ’ s been born into a world of , , and just in time to watch everything to pieces . i discovered all of that

I was sitting in my hideout watching cartoons when the news bulletin broke in on my video feed, announcing that James Halliday had died during the night....... Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the contest. I was sitting in my hideout watching cartoons when the news bulletin broke in on my video feed, announcing that James Halliday had died during the night. I’d heard of Halliday, of course. Everyone had. He was the videogame designer responsible for creating the OASIS, a massively multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved into the globally networked virtual reality most of humanity now used on a daily basis. The unprecedented success of the OASIS had made Halliday one of the wealthiest  in the world. At first, I couldn’t understand why the media was making such a big deal of the billionaire’s death. After all, the  of Planet Earth had other concerns. The ongoing energy crisis. Catastrophic climate change. Widespread famine, poverty, and disease. Half a dozen wars. You know: “dogs and cats living together … mass hysteria!” Normally, the newsfeeds didn’t interrupt everyone’s interactive sitcoms and soap operas unless something really major had happened. Like the outbreak of some new killer virus, or another major city vanishing in a mushroom cloud. Big stuff like that. As famous as he was, Halliday’s death should have warranted only a brief segment on the evening news, so the unwashed masses could shake their heads in envy when the newscasters announced the obscenely large amount of  that would be doled out to the rich man’s heirs.  But that was the rub. James Halliday had no heirs.  
He had died a sixty-seven-year-old bachelor, with no living relatives and, by most accounts, without a single friend. He’d spent the last fifteen years of his life in self-imposed isolation, during which time—if the rumors were to be believed—he’d gone completely insane. So the  jaw-dropping news that January morning, the news that had everyone from Toronto to Tokyo crapping in their cornflakes, concerned the contents of Halliday’s last will and testament, and the fate of his vast fortune.  
  
  Halliday had prepared a short video message, along with instructions that it be released to the world media at the time of his death. He’d also arranged to have a copy of the video e-mailed to every single OASIS user that same morning. I still remember hearing the familiar electronic chime when it arrived in my inbox,  a few seconds after I saw that first news bulletin.  
  
  His video message was actually a meticulously constructed short film titled Anorak’s Invitation. A famous eccentric, Halliday had harbored a lifelong obsession with the 1980s, the decade during which he’d been a teenager, and Anorak’s Invitation was crammed with obscure ’80s pop culture references, nearly all of which were lost on me the first time I viewed it.  
  
  The entire video was  over five minutes in length, and in the days and weeks that followed, it would become the most scrutinized piece of film in history, surpassing even the Zapruder film in the amount of painstaking frame-by-frame analysis devoted to it. My entire generation would come to know every second of Halliday’s message by heart.  
  
  Anorak’s Invitation begins with the sound of trumpets, the opening of an old song called “Dead Man’s Party.”  
  
  The song plays over a dark screen for the first few seconds, until the trumpets are joined by a guitar, and that’s when Halliday appears. But he’s not a sixty-seven-year-old man, ravaged by time and illness. He looks  as he did on the cover of Time magazine back in 2014, a tall, thin, healthy man in his early forties, with unkempt hair and his trademark horn-rimmed eyeglasses. He’s also wearing the same clothing he wore in the Time cover photo: faded jeans and a vintage Space Invaders T-shirt.  
  
  Halliday is at a high-school dance being held in a large gymnasium. He’s surrounded by teenagers whose clothing, hairstyles, and dance moves all indicate that the time period is the late 1980s.\* Halliday is dancing, too—something no one ever saw him do in  life. Grinning maniacally, he spins in rapid circles, swinging his arms and head in time with the song, flawlessly cycling through several signature ’80s dance moves. But Halliday has no dance partner. He is, as the saying goes, dancing with himself.  
  
  A few lines of text appear briefly at the lower left-hand corner of the screen, listing the name of the band, the song’s title, the record label, and the year of release, as if this were an old music video airing on MTV: Oingo Boingo, “Dead Man’s Party,” MCA Records, 1985.  
  
  When the lyrics kick in, Halliday begins to lip-synch along, still gyrating: “All dressed up with nowhere to go. Walking with a dead man over my shoulder. ’t run away, it’s only me.…”  
  
  He abruptly stops dancing and makes a cutting motion with his  hand, silencing the music. At the same moment, the dancers and the gymnasium behind him vanish, and the scene around him suddenly changes.  
  
  Halliday now stands at the front of a funeral parlor, next to an open casket.† A second, much older Halliday lies inside the casket, his body emaciated and ravaged by cancer. Shiny quarters cover each of his eyelids.

The younger Halliday gazes down at the corpse of his older self with mock sadness, then turns to address the assembled mourners.§ Halliday snaps his fingers and a scroll appears in his  hand. He opens it with a flourish and it unfurls to the floor, unraveling down the aisle in front of him. He breaks the fourth wall, addressing the viewer, and begins to read.  
  
  “I, James Donovan Halliday, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby make, publish, and declare this instrument to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made.…” He continues reading, faster and faster, plowing through several more paragraphs of legalese, until he’s speaking so rapidly that the words are unintelligible. Then he stops abruptly. “Forget it,” he says. “Even at that speed, it would take me a month to read the whole thing. Sad to say, I ’t have that kind of time.” He drops the scroll and it vanishes in a shower of gold dust. “Let me  give you the highlights.”  
  
  The funeral parlor vanishes, and the scene changes once again. Halliday now stands in front of an immense bank vault door. “My entire estate, including a controlling share of stock in my company, Gregarious Simulation Systems, is to be placed in escrow until such time as a single condition I have set forth in my will is met. The first individual to meet that condition will inherit my entire fortune, currently valued in excess of two hundred and forty billion dollars.”  
  
  The vault door swings open and Halliday walks inside. The interior of the vault is enormous, and it contains a huge stack of gold bars, roughly the size of a large house. “Here’s the dough I’m putting up for grabs,” Halliday says, grinning broadly. “What the hell. You can’t take it with you, ?”  
  
  Halliday leans against the stack of gold bars, and the camera pulls in tight on his face. “Now, I’m sure you’re wondering, what do you have to do to get your hands on all this moolah? Well, hold your horses, kids. I’m getting to that.…” He pauses dramatically, his expression changing to that of a child about to reveal a very big secret.  
  
  Halliday snaps his fingers again and the vault disappears. In the same instant, Halliday shrinks and morphs into a small boy wearing brown corduroys and a faded The Muppet Show T-shirt.\* The young Halliday stands in a cluttered living room with burnt orange carpeting, wood-paneled walls, and kitschy late-’70s decor. A 21-inch Zenith television sits nearby, with an Atari 2600 game console hooked up to it.  
  
  “This was the first videogame system I ever owned,” Halliday says, now in a child’s voice. “An Atari 2600. I got it for Christmas in 1979.” He plops down in front of the Atari, picks up a joystick, and begins to play. “My favorite game was this one,” he says, nodding at the TV screen, where a small square is traveling through a series of simple mazes. “It was called Adventure. Like many early videogames, Adventure was designed and programmed by  one person. But back then, Atari refused to give its programmers credit for their work, so the name of a game’s creator didn’t actually appear anywhere on the packaging.” On the TV screen, we see Halliday use a sword to slay a red dragon, although due to the game’s crude low-resolution graphics, this looks more like a square using an arrow to stab a deformed duck.  
  
  “So the guy who created Adventure, a man named Warren Robinett, decided to hide his name inside the game itself. He hid a key in one of the game’s labyrinths. If you found this key, a small pixel-sized gray dot, you could use it to enter a secret room where Robinett had hidden his name.” On the TV, Halliday guides his square protagonist into the game’s secret room, where the words CREATED BY WARREN ROBINETT appear in the center of the screen.  
  
  “This,” Halliday says, pointing to the screen with genuine reverence, “was the very first videogame Easter egg. Robinett hid it in his game’s code without telling a soul, and Atari manufactured and shipped Adventure all over the world without knowing about the secret room. They didn’t find out about the Easter egg’s existence until a few months later, when kids all over the world began to discover it. I was one of those kids, and finding Robinett’s Easter egg for the first time was one of the coolest videogaming experiences of my life.”  
  
  The young Halliday drops his joystick and stands. As he does, the living room fades away, and the scene shifts again. Halliday now stands in a dim cavern, where light from unseen torches flickers off the damp walls. In the same instant, Halliday’s appearance also changes once again, as he morphs into his famous OASIS avatar, Anorak—a tall, robed wizard with a slightly more handsome version of the adult Halliday’s face (minus the eyeglasses). Anorak is dressed in his trademark black robes, with his avatar’s emblem (a large calligraphic letter “A”) embroidered on each sleeve.  
  
  “Before I died,” Anorak says, speaking in a much deeper voice, “I created my own Easter egg, and hid it somewhere inside my most popular videogame—the OASIS. The first person to find my Easter egg will inherit my entire fortune.”  
  
  Another dramatic pause.  
  
  “The egg is well hidden. I didn’t  leave it lying under a rock somewhere. I suppose you could say that it’s locked inside a safe that is buried in a secret room that lies hidden at the center of a maze located somewhere”—he reaches up to tap his  temple—“up here.  
  
  “But ’t worry. I’ve left a few clues lying around to get everyone started. And here’s the first one.” Anorak makes a grand gesture with his  hand, and three keys appear, spinning slowly in the air in front of him. They appear to be made of copper, jade, and clear crystal. As the keys continue to spin, Anorak recites a piece of verse, and as he speaks each line, it appears briefly in flaming subtitles across the bottom of screen:  
  
  Three hidden keys open three secret gates  
  
  Wherein the errant will be tested for worthy traits  
  
  And those with the skill to survive these straits  
  
  Will reach The End where the prize awaits  
  
  As he finishes, the jade and crystal keys vanish, leaving only the copper key, which now hangs on a chain around Anorak’s neck.  
  
  The camera follows Anorak as he turns and continues farther into the dark cavern. A few seconds later, he arrives at a pair of massive wooden doors set into the cavern’s rocky wall. These doors are banded with steel, and there are shields and dragons carved into their surfaces. “I couldn’t playtest this particular game, so I worry that I may have hidden my Easter egg a little too well. Made it too difficult to reach. I’m not sure. If that’s the case, it’s too late to change anything now. So I guess we’ll see.”  
  
  Anorak throws open the double doors, revealing an immense treasure room filled with piles of glittering gold coins and jewel-encrusted goblets.\* Then he steps into the open doorway and turns to face the viewer, stretching out his arms to hold open the giant double doors.†  
  
  “So without further ado,” Anorak announces, “let the hunt for Halliday’s Easter egg begin!” Then he vanishes in a flash of light, leaving the viewer to gaze through the open doorway at the glittering mounds of treasure that lay beyond.  
  
  Then the screen fades to black.  
  
  At the end of the video, Halliday included a link to his personal website, which had changed drastically on the morning of his death. For over a decade, the only thing posted there had been a short looping animation that showed his avatar, Anorak, sitting in a medieval library, hunched over a scarred worktable, mixing potions and poring over dusty spellbooks, with a large painting of a black dragon visible on the wall behind him.  
  
  But now that animation was gone, and in its place there was a high-score list like those that used to appear in old coin-operated videogames. The list had ten numbered spots, and each displayed the initials JDH—James Donovan Halliday—followed by a score of six zeros. This high-score list quickly came to be known as “the Scoreboard.”  
  
   below the Scoreboard was an icon that looked like a small leather-bound book, which linked to a free downloadable copy of Anorak’s Almanac, a collection of hundreds of Halliday’s undated journal entries. The Almanac was over a thousand pages long, but it co  
ntained few details about Halliday’s personal life or his day-to-day activities. Most of the entries were his stream-of-consciousness observations on various classic videogames, -fiction and fantasy novels, movies, comic books, and ’80s pop culture, mixed with humorous diatribes denouncing everything from organized religion to diet soda.  
  
  The Hunt, as the contest came to be known, quickly wove its way into global culture. Like winning the lottery, finding Halliday’s Easter egg became a popular fantasy among adults and children alike. It was a game anyone could play, and at first, there seemed to be no  or wrong way to play it. The only thing Anorak’s Almanac seemed to indicate was that a familiarity with Halliday’s various obsessions would be essential to finding the egg. This led to a global fascination with 1980s pop culture. Fifty years after the decade had ended, the movies, music, games, and fashions of the 1980s were all the rage once again. By 2041, spiked hair and acid-washed jeans were back in style, and covers of hit ’80s pop songs by contemporary bands dominated the music charts.  who had actually been teenagers in the 1980s, all now approaching old age, had the strange experience of seeing the fads and fashions of their youth embraced and studied by their grandchildren.  
  
  A new subculture was born, composed of the millions of  who now devoted every free moment of their lives to searching for Halliday’s egg. At first, these individuals were known simply as “egg hunters,” but this was quickly truncated to the nickname “gunters.”  
  
  During the first year of the Hunt, being a gunter was highly fashionable, and nearly every OASIS user claimed to be one.  
  
  When the first anniversary of Halliday’s death arrived, the fervor surrounding the contest began to die down. An entire year had passed and no one had found anything. Not a single key or gate. Part of the problem was the sheer size of the OASIS. It contained thousands of simulated worlds where the keys might be hidden, and it could take a gunter years to conduct a thorough search of any one of them.  
  
  Despite all of the “professional” gunters who boasted on their blogs that they were getting closer to a breakthrough every day, the truth gradually became apparent: No one really even knew exactly what it was they were looking for, or where to start looking for it.  
  
  Another year passed.  
  
  And another.  
  
  Still nothing.  
  
  The general public lost all interest in the contest.  began to assume it was all  an outlandish  perpetrated by a rich nut job. Others believed that even if the egg really did exist, no one was ever going to find it. Meanwhile, the OASIS continued to evolve and grow in popularity, protected from takeover attempts and legal challenges by the ironclad terms of Halliday’s will and the army of rabid lawyers he had tasked with administering his estate.  
  
  Halliday’s Easter egg gradually moved into the realm of urban legend, and the ever-dwindling tribe of gunters gradually became the object of ridicule. Each year, on the anniversary of Halliday’s death, newscasters jokingly reported on their continued lack of progress. And each year, more gunters called it quits, concluding that Halliday had indeed made the egg impossible to find.  
  
  And another year went by.  
  
  And another.  
  
  Then, on the evening of February 11, 2045, an avatar’s name appeared at the top of the Scoreboard, for the whole world to see. After five long years, the Copper Key had finally been found, by an eighteen-year-old kid living in a trailer park on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.  
  
  That kid was me.  
  
  Dozens of books, cartoons, movies, and miniseries have attempted to tell the story of everything that happened next, but every single one of them got it wrong. So I want to set the record straight, once and for all.  
  
  \* Careful analysis of this scene reveals that all of the teenagers behind Halliday are actually extras from various John Hughes teen films who have been digitally cut-and-pasted into the video.  
  
  † His surroundings are actually from a scene in the 1989 film Heathers. Halliday appears to have digitally re-created the funeral parlor set and then inserted himself into it.  
  
  ‡ High-resolution scrutiny reveals that both quarters were minted in 1984.

  I was jolted awake by the sound of gunfire in one of the neighboring stacks. The shots were followed by a few minutes of muffled shouting and screaming, then silence.  
  
  Gunfire wasn’t uncommon in the stacks, but it still shook me up. I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep, so I decided to kill the remaining hours until dawn by brushing up on a few coin-op classics. Galaga, Defender, Asteroids. These games were outdated digital dinosaurs that had become museum pieces long before I was born. But I was a gunter, so I didn’t think of them as quaint low-res antiques. To me, they were hallowed artifacts. Pillars of the pantheon. When I played the classics, I did so with a determined sort of reverence.  
  
  I was curled up in an old sleeping bag in the corner of the trailer’s tiny laundry room, wedged into the gap between the wall and the dryer. I wasn’t welcome in my aunt’s room across the hall, which was fine by me. I preferred to crash in the laundry room anyway. It was warm, it afforded me a limited amount of privacy, and the wireless reception wasn’t too bad. And, as an added bonus, the room smelled like liquid detergent and fabric softener. The rest of the trailer reeked of cat piss and abject poverty.  
  
  Most of the time I slept in my hideout. But the temperature had dropped below zero the past few nights, and as much as I hated staying at my aunt’s place, it still beat freezing to death.  
  
  A total of fifteen  lived in my aunt’s trailer. She slept in the smallest of its three bedrooms. The Depperts lived in the bedroom adjacent to hers, and the Millers occupied the large master bedroom at the end of the hall. There were six of them, and they paid the largest share of the rent. Our trailer wasn’t as crowded as some of the other units in the stacks. It was a double-wide. Plenty of room for everybody.  
  
  I pulled out my laptop and powered it on. It was a bulky, heavy beast, almost ten years old. I’d found it in a trash bin behind the abandoned strip mall across the highway. I’d been able to coax it back to life by replacing its system memory and reloading the stone-age operating system. The processor was slower than a sloth by current standards, but it was fine for my needs. The laptop served as my portable research library, video arcade, and home theater system. Its hard drive was filled with old books, movies, TV show episodes, song files, and nearly every videogame made in the twentieth century.  
  
  I booted up my emulator and selected Robotron: 2084, one of my all-time favorite games. I’d always loved its frenetic pace and brutal simplicity. Robotron was all about instinct and reflexes. Playing old videogames never failed to clear my mind and set me at ease. If I was feeling depressed or frustrated about my lot in life, all I had to do was tap the Player One button, and my worries would instantly slip away as my mind focused itself on the relentless pixelated onslaught on the screen in front of me. There, inside the game’s two-dimensional universe, life was simple: It’s  you against the machin  
e. Move with your left hand, shoot with your , and try to stay alive as long as possible.  
  
  I spent a few hours blasting through wave after wave of Brains, Spheroids, Quarks, and Hulks in my unending battle to Save the Last Human Family! But eventually my fingers started to cramp up and I began to lose my rhythm. When that happened at this level, things deteriorated quickly. I burned through all of my extra lives in a matter of minutes, and my two least-favorite words appeared on the screen: GAME OVER.  
  
  I shut down the emulator and began to browse through my video files. Over the past five years, I’d downloaded every single movie, TV show, and cartoon mentioned in Anorak’s Almanac. I still hadn’t watched all of them yet, of course. That would probably take decades.  
  
  I selected an episode of Family Ties, an ’80s sitcom about a middleclass family living in central Ohio. I’d downloaded the show because it had been one of Halliday’s favorites, and I figured there was a chance that some clue related to the Hunt might be hidden in one of the episodes. I’d become addicted to the show immediately, and had now watched all 180 episodes, multiple times. I never seemed to get tired of them.  
  
  Sitting alone in the dark, watching the show on my laptop, I always found myself imagining that I lived in that warm, well-lit house, and that those smiling, understanding  were my family. That there was nothing so wrong in the world that we couldn’t sort it out by the end of a single half-hour episode (or maybe a two-parter, if it was something really serious).  
  
  My own home life had never even remotely resembled the one depicted in Family Ties, which was probably why I loved the show so much. I was the only child of two teenagers, both refugees who’d met in the stacks where I’d grown up. I ’t remember my father. When I was  a few months old, he was shot dead while looting a grocery store during a power blackout. The only thing I really knew about him was that he loved comic books. I’d found several old flash drives in a box of his things, containing complete runs of The Amazing Spider-Man, The X-Men, and Green Lantern. My mom once told me that my dad had given me an alliterative name, Wade Watts, because he thought it sounded like the secret identity of a superhero. Like Peter Parker or Clark Kent. Knowing that made me think he must have been a cool guy, despite how he’d died.  
  
  My mother, Loretta, had raised me on her own. We’d lived in a small RV in another part of the stacks. She had two full-time OASIS jobs, one as a telemarketer, the other as an escort in an online brothel. She used to make me wear earplugs at night so I wouldn’t hear her in the next room, talking dirty to tricks in other time zones. But the earplugs didn’t work very well, so I would watch old movies instead, with the volume turned way up.  
  
  I was introduced to the OASIS at an early age, because my mother used it as a virtual babysitter. As soon as I was old enough to wear a visor and a pair of haptic gloves, my mom helped me create my first OASIS avatar. Then she stuck me in a corner and went back to work, leaving me to explore an entirely new world, very different from the one I’d known up until then.  
  
  From that moment on, I was more or less raised by the OASIS’s interactive educational programs, which any kid could access for free. I spent a big chunk of my childhood hanging out in a virtual-reality simulation of Sesame Street, singing songs with friendly Muppets and playing interactive games that taught me how to walk, talk, add, subtract, read, write, and share. Once I’d mastered those skills, it didn’t take me long to discover that the OASIS was also the world’s biggest public library, where even a penniless kid like me had access to every book ever written, every song ever recorded, and every movie, television show, videogame, and piece of artwork ever created. The collected knowledge, art, and amusements of all human civilization were there, waiting for me. But gaining access to all of that information turned out to be something of a mixed blessing. Because that was when I found out the truth.  
  
  I ’t know, maybe your experience differed from mine. For me, growing up as a human being on the planet Earth in the twenty-first century was a  kick in the teeth. Existentially speaking.  
  
  The worst thing about being a kid was that no one told me the truth about my situation. In fact, they did the exact opposite. And, of course, I believed them, because I was  a kid and I didn’t know any better. I mean, Christ, my brain hadn’t even grown to full size yet, so how could I be expected to know when the adults were bullshitting me?  
  
  So I swallowed all of the dark ages nonsense they fed me. Some time passed. I grew up a little, and I gradually began to figure out that pretty much everyone had been lying to me about pretty much everything since the moment I emerged from my mother’s womb.  
  
  This was an alarming revelation.  
  
  It gave me trust issues later in life.  
  
  I started to figure out the ugly truth as soon as I began to explore the free OASIS libraries. The facts were  there waiting for me, hidden in old books written by  who weren’t afraid to be honest. Artists and scientists and philosophers and poets, many of them long dead. As I read the words they’d left behind, I finally began to get a grip on the situation. My situation. Our situation. What most  referred to as “the human condition.”  
  
  It was not good news.  
  
  I wish someone had  told me the truth  up front, as soon as I was old enough to understand it. I wish someone had  said:  
  
  “Here’s the deal, Wade. You’re something called a ‘human being.’ That’s a really smart kind of animal. Like every other animal on this planet, we’re descended from a single-celled organism that lived millions of years ago. This happened by a process called evolution, and you’ll learn more about it later. But trust me, that’s really how we all got here. There’s proof of it everywhere, buried in the rocks. That story you heard? About how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named God who lives up in the sky? Total bullshit. The whole God thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that  have been telling one another for thousands of years. We made it all up. Like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.  
  
  “Oh, and by the way … there’s no Santa Claus or Easter Bunny. Also bullshit. Sorry, kid. Deal with it.  
  
  “You’re probably wondering what happened before you got here. An awful lot of stuff, actually. Once we evolved into humans, things got pretty interesting. We figured out how to grow food and domesticate animals so we didn’t have to spend all of our time hunting. Our tribes got much bigger, and we spread across the entire planet like an unstoppable virus. Then, after fighting a bunch of wars with each other over land, resources, and our made-up gods, we eventually got all of our tribes organized into a ‘global civilization.’ But, honestly, it wasn’t all that organized, or civilized, and we continued to fight a lot of wars with each other. But we also figured out how to do , which helped us develop technology. For a bunch of hairless apes, we’ve actually managed to invent some pretty incredible things. Computers. Medicine. Lasers. Microwave ovens. Artificial hearts. Atomic bombs. We even sent a few guys to the moon and brought them back. We also created a global communications network that lets us all talk to each other, all around the world, all the time. Pretty impressive, ?  
  
  “But that’s where the bad news comes in. Our global civilization came at a huge cost. We needed a whole bunch of energy to build it, and we got that energy by burning fossil fuels, which came from dead plants and animals buried deep in the ground. We used up most of this fuel before you got here, and now it’s pretty much all gone. This means that we no longer have enough energy to keep our civilization running like it was before. So we’ve had to cut back. Big-time. We call this the Global Energy Crisis, and it’s been going on for a while now.  
  
  “Also, it turns out that burning all of those fossil fuels had some nasty side effects, like raising the temperature of our planet and screwing up the environment. So now the polar ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and the weather is all messed up. Plants and animals are dying off in record numbers, and lots of  are starving and homeless. And we’re still fighting wars with each other, mostly over the few resources we have left.  
  
  “Basically, kid, what this all means is that life is a lot tougher than it used to be, in the Good Old Days, back before you were born. Things used to be awesome, but now they’re kinda terrifying. To be honest, the future doesn’t look too bright. You were born at a pretty crappy time in history. And it looks like things are only gonna get worse from here on out. Human civilization is in ‘decline.’ Some  even say it’s ‘collapsing.’  
  
  “You’re probably wondering what’s going to happen to you. That’s easy. The same thing is going to happen to you that has happened to every other human being who has ever lived. You’re going to die. We all die. That’s  how it is.  
  
  “What happens when you die? Well, we’re not completely sure. But the evidence seems to suggest that nothing happens. You’re  dead, your brain stops working, and then you’re not around to ask annoying questions anymore. Those stories you heard? About going to a wonderful place called ‘heaven’ where there is no more pain or death and you live forever in a state of perpetual happiness? Also total bullshit.  like all that God stuff. There’s no evidence of a heaven and there never was. We made that up too. Wishful thinking. So now you have to live the rest of your life knowing you’re going to die someday and disappear forever.  
  
  “Sorry.”  
  
  OK, on second thought, maybe honesty isn’t the best policy after all. Maybe it isn’t a good idea to tell a newly arrived human being that he’s been born into a world of chaos, pain, and poverty  in time to watch everything fall to pieces. I discovered all of that gradually over several years, and it still made me feel like jumping off a bridge.  
  
  Luckily, I had access to the OASIS, which was like having an escape hatch into a better reality","player one : everyone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first

. the of some new , or another major city vanishing in a mushroom . big stuff that . as as he was , halliday ’ s should have warranted only a brief segment on the evening news , so the unwashed masses could their heads in when the newscasters announced the large amount of  that would be doled out to the man ’ s heirs . but that was the rub . james halliday had no heirs . he had a sixty-seven-year-old bachelor , with no living relatives and , by most accounts , without a single friend . he ’ d spent the last fifteen years of his life in self-imposed , during which time—if the were to be believed—he ’ d gone completely . so the  news that january morning , the news that had everyone from toronto to tokyo crapping in their cornflakes , the contents of halliday ’ s last will and testament , and the fate of his vast . halliday had prepared a short video message , along with instructions that it be released to the world media at the time of his . he ’ d also arranged to have a copy of the video e-mailed to every single user that same morning . i still remember hearing the familiar electronic chime when it arrived in my inbox ,  a few seconds after i saw that first news bulletin . his video message was actually a constructed short film titled anorak ’ s invitation . a , halliday had harbored a lifelong with the 1980s , the decade during which he ’ d been a teenager , and anorak ’ s invitation was crammed with ’ 80s pop culture references , nearly all of which were on me the first time i viewed it . the entire video was  over five minutes in length , and in the days and weeks that followed , it would become the most scrutinized piece of film in history , surpassing even the zapruder film in the amount of painstaking frame-by-frame analysis devoted to it . my entire generation would come to know every second of halliday ’ s message by heart . anorak ’ s invitation begins with the sound of trumpets , the opening of an old song called “ man ’ s party. ” the song plays over a screen for the first few seconds , until the trumpets are joined by a guitar , and that ’ s when halliday appears . but he ’ s not a sixty-seven-year-old man , ravaged by time and . he looks  as he did on the cover of time magazine back in 2014 , a tall , thin , man in his early forties , with unkempt hair and his trademark horn-rimmed eyeglasses . he ’ s also wearing the same clothing he wore in the time cover photo : faded jeans and a vintage space invaders t-shirt . halliday is at a high-school dance being held in a large gymnasium . he ’ s surrounded by teenagers whose clothing , hairstyles , and dance moves all indicate that the time period is the late 1980s.\ * halliday is dancing , too—something no one ever saw him do in  life . grinning maniacally , he spins in circles , swinging his arms and head in time with the song , cycling through several signature ’ 80s dance moves . but halliday has no dance partner . he is , as the saying goes , dancing with himself . a few lines of text appear briefly at the lower left-hand corner of the screen , listing the name of the band , the song ’ s title , the record label , and the year of release , as if this were an old music video airing on mtv : oingo boingo , “ man ’ s party , ” mca records , 1985. when the lyrics kick in , halliday begins to lip-synch along , still gyrating : “ all dressed up with nowhere to go . walking with a man over my shoulder . don ’ t run away , it ’ s only me.… ” he stops dancing and makes a cutting motion with his hand , silencing the music . at the same moment , the dancers and the gymnasium behind him vanish , and the scene around him suddenly changes . halliday now stands at the front of a funeral parlor , next to an open casket.† a second , much older halliday inside the casket , his body and ravaged by . quarters cover each of his eyelids . the younger halliday gazes down at the corpse of his older self with , then turns to address the assembled mourners.§ halliday snaps his fingers and a scroll appears in his hand . he opens it with a and it unfurls to the floor , unraveling down the aisle in front of him . he the fourth wall , addressing the viewer , and begins to read . “ i , james donovan halliday , being of sound mind and disposing memory , do hereby make , publish , and declare this instrument to be my last will and testament , hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made.… ” he continues reading , and , plowing through several more paragraphs of legalese , until he ’ s speaking so rapidly that the words are . then he stops . “ forget it , ” he says . “ even at that speed , it would take me a month to read the whole thing . to say , i don ’ t have that kind of time. ” he drops the scroll and it vanishes in a shower of . “ let me  give you the highlights. ” the funeral parlor vanishes , and the scene changes once again . halliday now stands in front of an bank vault door . “ my entire estate , including a controlling share of stock in my company , gregarious simulation systems , is to be placed in escrow until such time as a single condition i have set forth in my will is met . the first individual to meet that condition will inherit my entire , currently valued in excess of two hundred and forty billion dollars. ” the vault door swings open and halliday walks inside . the interior of the vault is enormous , and it contains a huge stack of bars , roughly the size of a large house . “ here ’ s the dough i ’ m putting up for grabs , ” halliday says , grinning broadly . “ what the . you can ’ t take it with you , ? ” halliday leans against the stack of bars , and the camera pulls in tight on his face . “ now , i ’ m sure you ’ re wondering , what do you have to do to get your hands on all this moolah ? , hold your horses , kids . i ’ m getting to that.… ” he pauses dramatically , his expression changing to that of a child about to reveal a very big secret . halliday snaps his fingers again and the vault disappears . in the same instant , halliday shrinks and morphs into a small boy wearing brown corduroys and a faded the muppet show t-shirt.\ * the young halliday stands in a cluttered living room with burnt orange carpeting , wood-paneled walls , and kitschy late- ’ 70s decor . a 21-inch television sits nearby , with an atari 2600 game console hooked up to it . “ this was the first videogame system i ever owned , ” halliday says , now in a child ’ s voice . “ an atari 2600. i got it for christmas in 1979. ” he plops down in front of the atari , picks up a joystick , and begins to play . “ my game was this one , ” he says , nodding at the tv screen , where a small square is traveling through a series of simple mazes . “ it was called adventure . many early videogames , adventure was designed and programmed by  one person . but back then , atari to give its programmers credit for their , so the name of a game ’ s creator didn ’ t actually appear anywhere on the packaging. ” on the tv screen , we see halliday use a sword to slay a red dragon , although due to the game ’ s low-resolution graphics , this looks more a square using an arrow to a duck . “ so the guy who created adventure , a man named warren robinett , decided to hide his name inside the game itself . he hid a key in one of the game ’ s labyrinths . if you found this key , a small pixel-sized gray dot , you could use it to enter a secret room where robinett had hidden his name. ” on the tv , halliday guides his square protagonist into the game ’ s secret room , where the words created by warren robinett appear in the center of the screen . “ this , ” halliday says , pointing to the screen with , “ was the very first videogame easter egg . robinett hid it in his game ’ s code without telling a soul , and atari manufactured and shipped adventure all over the world without knowing about the secret room . they didn ’ t find out about the easter egg ’ s existence until a few months later , when kids all over the world began to discover it . i was one of those kids , and finding robinett ’ s easter egg for the first time was one of the videogaming experiences of my life. ” the young halliday drops his joystick and stands . as he does , the living room fades away , and the scene shifts again . halliday now stands in a cavern , where light from unseen torches off the damp walls . in the same instant , halliday ’ s appearance also changes once again , as he morphs into his avatar , anorak—a tall , robed wizard with a slightly more version of the adult halliday ’ s face ( minus the eyeglasses ) . anorak is dressed in his trademark black robes , with his avatar ’ s emblem ( a large calligraphic letter “ a ” ) embroidered on each sleeve . “ before i , ” anorak says , speaking in a much deeper voice , “ i created my own easter egg , and hid it somewhere inside my most videogame—the . the first person to find my easter egg will inherit my entire fortune. ” another dramatic pause . “ the egg is hidden . i didn ’ t  leave it under a rock somewhere . i suppose you could say that it ’ s locked inside a that is buried in a secret room that hidden at the center of a maze located somewhere ” —he reaches up to tap his temple— “ up here . “ but don ’ t . i ’ ve left a few clues around to get everyone started . and here ’ s the first one. ” anorak makes a gesture with his hand , and three keys appear , spinning in the air in front of him . they appear to be made of copper , jade , and crystal . as the keys continue to spin , anorak recites a piece of verse , and as he speaks each line , it appears briefly in flaming subtitles across the bottom of screen : three hidden keys open three secret gates wherein the will be tested for traits and those with the to survive these straits will reach the end where the awaits as he finishes , the jade and crystal keys vanish , leaving only the copper key , which now on a chain around anorak ’ s neck . the camera follows anorak as he turns and continues farther into the cavern . a few seconds later , he arrives at a pair of massive wooden doors set into the cavern ’ s wall . these doors are banded with steel , and there are shields and dragons carved into their surfaces . “ i couldn ’ t playtest this particular game , so i that i may have hidden my easter egg a little too . made it too to reach . i ’ m not sure . if that ’ s the case , it ’ s too late to change anything now . so i guess we ’ ll see. ” anorak throws open the double doors , revealing an room filled with piles of glittering coins and jewel-encrusted goblets.\ * then he steps into the open doorway and turns to face the viewer , stretching out his arms to hold open the giant double doors.† “ so without further ado , ” anorak announces , “ let the hunt for halliday ’ s easter egg begin ! ” then he vanishes in a flash of light , leaving the viewer to gaze through the open doorway at the glittering mounds of that lay beyond . then the screen fades to black . at the end of the video , halliday included a link to his personal website , which had changed on the morning of his . for over a decade , the only thing posted there had been a short looping animation that showed his avatar , anorak , sitting in a medieval library , hunched over a worktable , mixing potions and poring over spellbooks , with a large painting of a black dragon visible on the wall behind him . but now that animation was gone , and in its place there was a high-score list those that used to appear in old coin-operated videogames . the list had ten numbered spots , and each displayed the initials jdh—james donovan halliday—followed by a score of six zeros . this high-score list quickly came to be known as “ the scoreboard. ”  below the scoreboard was an icon that looked a small leather-bound book , which linked to a downloadable copy of anorak ’ s almanac , a collection of hundreds of halliday ’ s undated journal entries . the almanac was over a thousand pages long , but it co ntained few details about halliday ’ s personal life or his day-to-day activities . most of the entries were his stream-of-consciousness observations on various videogames , -fiction and fantasy novels , movies , comic books , and ’ 80s pop culture , mixed with denouncing everything from organized religion to diet soda . the hunt , as the contest came to be known , quickly wove its way into global culture . the lottery , finding halliday ’ s easter egg became a fantasy among adults and children alike . it was a game anyone could play , and at first , there seemed to be no or way to play it . the only thing anorak ’ s almanac seemed to indicate was that a familiarity with halliday ’ s various would be essential to finding the egg . this to a global with 1980s pop culture . fifty years after the decade had ended , the movies , music , games , and fashions of the 1980s were all the once again . by 2041 , spiked hair and acid-washed jeans were back in style , and covers of hit ’ 80s pop songs by contemporary bands the music charts .  who had actually been teenagers in the 1980s , all now approaching old age , had the experience of seeing the fads and fashions of their youth embraced and studied by their grandchildren . a new subculture was born , composed of the millions of  who now devoted every moment of their lives to searching for halliday ’ s egg . at first , these individuals were known simply as “ egg hunters , ” but this was quickly truncated to the nickname “ gunters. ” during the first year of the hunt , being a gunter was highly , and nearly every user claimed to be one . when the first anniversary of halliday ’ s arrived , the surrounding the contest began to down . an entire year had passed and no one had found anything . not a single key or gate . part of the was the sheer size of the . it contained thousands of simulated worlds where the keys might be hidden , and it could take a gunter years to conduct a thorough search of any one of them . despite all of the “ professional ” gunters who boasted on their blogs that they were getting closer to a every day , the truth gradually became apparent : no one really even knew exactly what it was they were looking for , or where to start looking for it . another year passed . and another . still nothing . the general public all interest in the contest .  began to assume it was all  an outlandish perpetrated by a nut job . others believed that even if the egg really did exist , no one was ever going to find it . meanwhile , the continued to evolve and grow in popularity , protected from takeover attempts and legal challenges by the ironclad terms of halliday ’ s will and the army of lawyers he had tasked with administering his estate . halliday ’ s easter egg gradually moved into the realm of urban legend , and the ever-dwindling tribe of gunters gradually became the of . each year , on the anniversary of halliday ’ s , newscasters jokingly reported on their continued of . and each year , more gunters called it quits , concluding that halliday had indeed made the egg to find . and another year went by . and another . then , on the evening of february 11 , 2045 , an avatar ’ s name appeared at the of the scoreboard , for the whole world to see . after five long years , the copper key had finally been found , by an eighteen-year-old kid living in a trailer park on the outskirts of oklahoma city . that kid was me . dozens of books , cartoons , movies , and miniseries have attempted to tell the story of everything that happened next , but every single one of them got it . so i want to set the record straight , once and for all . \ * careful analysis of

when i played the classics , i did so with a determined sort of . i was curled up in an old sleeping bag in the corner of the trailer ’ s tiny laundry room , wedged into the gap between the wall and the dryer . i wasn ’ t in my aunt ’ s room across the hall , which was by me . i preferred to in the laundry room anyway . it was , it afforded me a amount of privacy , and the wireless reception wasn ’ t too . and , as an added , the room liquid detergent and fabric softener . the rest of the trailer reeked of cat piss and abject . most of the time i slept in my hideout . but the temperature had dropped below zero the past few nights , and as much as i staying at my aunt ’ s place , it still beat to . a total of fifteen  lived in my aunt ’ s trailer . she slept in the smallest of its three bedrooms . the depperts lived in the bedroom adjacent to hers , and the millers occupied the large bedroom at the end of the hall . there were six of them , and they paid the largest share of the rent . our trailer wasn ’ t as as some of the other units in the stacks . it was a double-wide . plenty of room for everybody . i pulled out my laptop and powered it on . it was a , heavy beast , almost ten years old . i ’ d found it in a bin behind the abandoned strip mall across the highway . i ’ d been able to coax it back to life by replacing its system memory and reloading the stone-age operating system . the processor was than a by current standards , but it was for my needs . the laptop served as my research library , video arcade , and home theater system . its drive was filled with old books , movies , tv show episodes , song files , and nearly every videogame made in the twentieth century . i booted up my emulator and selected robotron : 2084 , one of my all-time games . i ’ d always its pace and simplicity . robotron was all about instinct and reflexes . playing old videogames never to my mind and set me at . if i was feeling or about my lot in life , all i had to do was tap the player one button , and my would slip away as my mind focused itself on the pixelated on the screen in front of me . there , inside the game ’ s two-dimensional universe , life was simple : it ’ s  you against the machin e. move with your left hand , shoot with your , and try to stay alive as long as possible . i spent a few hours blasting through wave after wave of brains , spheroids , quarks , and hulks in my unending battle to save the last human family ! but eventually my fingers started to up and i began to my rhythm . when that happened at this level , things deteriorated quickly . i through all of my extra lives in a matter of minutes , and my two least-favorite words appeared on the screen : game over . i shut down the emulator and began to browse through my video files . over the past five years , i ’ d downloaded every single movie , tv show , and cartoon mentioned in anorak ’ s almanac . i still hadn ’ t watched all of them yet , of course . that would probably take decades . i selected an episode of family ties , an ’ 80s sitcom about a middleclass family living in central ohio . i ’ d downloaded the show because it had been one of halliday ’ s favorites , and i figured there was a chance that some clue related to the hunt might be hidden in one of the episodes . i ’ d become to the show immediately , and had now watched all 180 episodes , multiple times . i never seemed to get of them . sitting alone in the , watching the show on my laptop , i always found myself imagining that i lived in that , well-lit house , and that those , understanding  were my family . that there was nothing so in the world that we couldn ’ t sort it out by the end of a single half-hour episode ( or maybe a two-parter , if it was something really serious ) . my own home life had never even remotely resembled the one depicted in family ties , which was probably why i the show so much . i was the only child of two teenagers , both refugees who ’ d met in the stacks where i ’ d grown up . i don ’ t remember my father . when i was  a few months old , he was shot while looting a grocery store during a power blackout . the only thing i really knew about him was that he comic books . i ’ d found several old flash drives in a box of his things , containing complete runs of the spider-man , the x-men , and green lantern . my mom once told me that my dad had given me an alliterative name , wade watts , because he thought it sounded the secret identity of a superhero . peter parker or clark kent . knowing that made me think he must have been a guy , despite how he ’ d . my mother , loretta , had raised me on her own . we ’ d lived in a small rv in another part of the stacks . she had two full-time jobs , one as a telemarketer , the other as an escort in an online brothel . she used to make me wear earplugs at night so i wouldn ’ t hear her in the next room , talking to tricks in other time zones . but the earplugs didn ’ t very , so i would watch old movies instead , with the volume turned way up . i was introduced to the at an early age , because my mother used it as a virtual babysitter . as soon as i was old to wear a visor and a pair of haptic gloves , my mom me create my first avatar . then she me in a corner and went back to , leaving me to explore an entirely new world , very different from the one i ’ d known up until then . from that moment on , i was more or less raised by the ’ s interactive educational programs , which any kid could access for . i spent a big chunk of my childhood hanging out in a virtual-reality simulation of sesame street , singing songs with muppets and playing interactive games that taught me how to walk , talk , add , , read , write , and share . once i ’ d mastered those skills , it didn ’ t take me long to discover that the was also the world ’ s biggest public library , where even a penniless kid me had access to every book ever written , every song ever recorded , and every movie , television show , videogame , and piece of artwork ever created . the collected knowledge , art , and amusements of all human civilization were there , waiting for me . but access to all of that information turned out to be something of a mixed . because that was when i found out the truth . i don ’ t know , maybe your experience differed from mine . for me , growing up as a human being on the planet earth in the twenty-first century was a  kick in the teeth . existentially speaking . the thing about being a kid was that no one told me the truth about my situation . in fact , they did the exact opposite . and , of course , i believed them , because i was  a kid and i didn ’ t know any . i mean , christ , my brain hadn ’ t even grown to full size yet , so how could i be expected to know when the adults were bullshitting me ? so i swallowed all of the ages they fed me . some time passed . i grew up a little , and i gradually began to figure out that much everyone had been to me about much everything since the moment i emerged from my mother ’ s womb . this was an . it gave me later in life . i started to figure out the truth as soon as i began to explore the libraries . the facts were there waiting for me , hidden in old books written by  who weren ’ t to be . artists and scientists and philosophers and poets , many of them long . as i read the words they ’ d left behind , i finally began to get a grip on the situation . my situation . our situation . what most  referred to as “ the human condition. ” it was not news . i wish someone had  told me the truth up front , as soon as i was old to understand it . i wish someone had  said : “ here ’ s the deal , wade . you ’ re something called a ‘ human being. ’ that ’ s a really kind of animal . every other animal on this planet , we ’ re descended from a single-celled organism that lived millions of years ago . this happened by a process called evolution , and you ’ ll learn more about it later . but me , that ’ s really how we all got here . there ’ s proof of it everywhere , buried in the rocks . that story you heard ? about how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named god who lives up in the sky ? total . the whole god thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that  have been telling one another for thousands of years . we made it all up . santa claus and the easter bunny . “ oh , and by the way … there ’ s no santa claus or easter bunny . also . , kid . deal with it . “ you ’ re probably wondering what happened before you got here . an lot of stuff , actually . once we evolved into humans , things got . we figured out how to grow food and domesticate animals so we didn ’ t have to spend all of our time hunting . our tribes got much bigger , and we spread across the entire planet an unstoppable . then , after fighting a bunch of wars with each other over land , resources , and our made-up gods , we eventually got all of our tribes organized into a ‘ global civilization. ’ but , honestly , it wasn ’ t all that organized , or civilized , and we continued to fight a lot of wars with each other . but we also figured out how to do  , which us develop technology . for a bunch of hairless apes , we ’ ve actually managed to invent some things . computers . medicine . lasers . microwave ovens . artificial hearts . atomic bombs . we even sent a few guys to the moon and brought them back . we also created a global communications network that lets us all talk to each other , all around the world , all the time . , ? “ but that ’ s where the news comes in . our global civilization came at a huge cost . we needed a whole bunch of energy to build it , and we got that energy by fossil fuels , which came from plants and animals buried deep in the ground . we used up most of this fuel before you got here , and now it ’ s much all gone . this means that we no longer have energy to keep our civilization running it was before . so we ’ ve had to cut back . big-time . we call this the global energy , and it ’ s been going on for a while now . “ also , it turns out that all of those fossil fuels had some side effects , raising the temperature of our planet and screwing up the environment . so now the polar ice caps are melting , sea levels are rising , and the weather is all up . plants and animals are off in record numbers , and lots of  are starving and homeless . and we ’ re still fighting wars with each other , mostly over the few resources we have left . “ basically , kid , what this all means is that life is a lot than it used to be , in the old days , back before you were born . things used to be , but now they ’ re kinda terrifying . to be , the future doesn ’ t look too . you were born at a time in history . and it looks things are only gon na get from here on out . human civilization is in ‘ decline. ’ some  even say it ’ s ‘ collapsing. ’ “ you ’ re probably wondering what ’ s going to happen to you . that ’ s . the same thing is going to happen to you that has happened to every other human being who has ever lived . you ’ re going to . we all . that ’ s  how it is . “ what happens when you ? , we ’ re not completely sure . but the evidence seems to suggest that nothing happens . you ’ re  , your brain stops working , and then you ’ re not around to ask questions anymore . those stories you heard ? about going to a place called ‘ ’ where there is no more or and you live forever in a state of perpetual ? also total .  all that god stuff . there ’ s no evidence of a and there never was . we made that up too . wishful thinking . so now you have to live the rest of your life knowing you ’ re going to someday and disappear forever . “ sorry. ” ok , on second thought , maybe isn ’ t the policy after all . maybe it isn ’ t a idea to tell a newly arrived human being that he ’ s been born into a world of , , and  in time to watch everything to pieces . i discovered all of that gradually over several years , and it still made me feel jumping off a bridge . luckily , i had access to the , which was having an escape hatch into a reality . the kept me . it was my playground"

Disclaimer: opinionated explainer

Despite Trump's efforts and judgment, States in the US are fighting for the climate. Before the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) - which allocated billions to help Americans electrify their homes and invested even more into the clean energy sector - neither Congress nor the executive branch had implemented climate policy that matched the scale of the crisis.

Still, carbon emissions have fallen by 1 billion tons annually, and now stand at 5 billion tons of carbon emissions. How is that possible?

Just before Trump's second term, the lawmakers met in a special session to start preparing a defense, including climate policies. Since then, the States have not backed down in trying to protect the climate. California, for example, is pushing utilities to move away from fossil fuels.

It is at the state level where climate progress continues.

Casey Katims, executive director of the U.S. Climate Alliance, ensures that “States (...) retain the authority and the ability and the ambition to drive down pollution and keep America on track to meet its goal.”

Wade Crowford, head of California's Natrual Resources Agency, explains how, thanks to federalism, States have a lot of power to reduce carbon emissions, as well as protect residents from climate impacts.

Another example is Maine. Last year, they announced they had reached their goal of installing 100,000 heat pumps two years ahead of schedule, in part thanks to state rebates. So if the Trump administration were to cut off the funding for heat pumps that the IRA provides, states could cover the expense.

Despite Trump’s declarations that climate change is a hoax, statehouses from Sacramento to Augusta are flicking switches on clean energy futures - one rebate, one regulation at a time. It may be less obvious but due to federal division of power clean energy and fewer carbon emissions are still on the rising!

What do you think about this development? And if you live in the US, have you noticed any climate-  
Related policies in your own state or city? What do you think about them? Does it give you hope?

**Climate change facts matter now more than ever.** As global warming accelerates and climate policy shapes our future, misinformation about climate science, carbon emissions, and renewable energy is everywhere. This in-depth guide uses the latest scientific research and authoritative sources to debunk the top 10 climate change myths-empowering you with accurate information that aligns with today’s highest search intent queries and Google’s ranking factors.

# Myth 1: “Climate Change Is Natural-Humans Aren’t Responsible”

**Fact:** The overwhelming scientific consensus confirms that **human activities are the primary driver of recent global warming**. Modern temperature increases are happening at a rate ten times faster than any natural cycle in the past 800,000 years. Over 99% of peer-reviewed climate studies attribute current climate change to **fossil fuel emissions**, not natural variability.

# Myth 2: “Cold Weather Proves Global Warming Is a Hoax”

**Fact:** **Weather and climate are not the same.** While local temperatures fluctuate, the global average temperature continues to rise. Extreme cold events, like polar vortex disruptions, are actually linked to **Arctic warming**\-a direct effect of climate change. The last decade was the hottest on record, despite occasional cold snaps.

# Myth 3: “CO2 Is Harmless-Plants Need It to Grow”

**Fact:** **Excess carbon dioxide is destabilizing Earth’s systems.** While plants use CO2 for photosynthesis, today’s concentrations far exceed natural levels, causing **ocean acidification**, reduced crop nutrition, and dangerous feedback loops. Higher CO2 does not mean healthier ecosystems or better food security.

# Myth 4: “Scientists Are Divided on Climate Change Causes”

**Fact:** **There is near-universal agreement among climate scientists:** human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change. The IPCC, NASA, and every major scientific academy worldwide support this conclusion. Only a tiny fraction of studies dispute it, often funded by fossil fuel interests.

# Myth 5: “Renewable Energy Is Too Expensive and Unreliable”

**Fact:** **Renewable energy is now the cheapest and fastest-growing power source globally.** Solar and wind costs have dropped over 80% in the past decade. Countries like Denmark and Texas run on high percentages of renewables with grid stability. Battery storage and green hydrogen are solving intermittency challenges.

# Myth 6: “Climate Models Can’t Be Trusted”

**Fact:** **Climate models have accurately predicted global warming trends for decades.** Modern models use advanced data and machine learning to forecast temperature rise, sea level changes, and extreme weather events with high precision. Their predictions are consistently validated by real-world observations.

# Myth 7: “China and India Are the Real Climate Problem”

**Fact:** **Climate responsibility is global, but historical emissions matter.** The United States and Europe have contributed the most carbon emissions since the industrial era. Per capita, Western nations still emit far more than developing countries. Many of China’s emissions come from manufacturing goods for export to the West.

# Myth 8: “The Sun Is Causing Global Warming”

**Fact:** **Solar activity has remained stable or declined as global temperatures soared.** Satellite data shows that greenhouse gases-not solar output-are responsible for recent warming. If the sun were to blame, all atmospheric layers would warm, but only the lower atmosphere is heating up.

# Myth 9: “Climate Action Will Destroy the Economy”

**Fact:** **Climate solutions drive economic growth and job creation.** Clean energy industries are booming, creating millions of jobs and saving trillions in health and disaster costs. The transition to net zero is expected to add $43 trillion to the global economy by 2070, according to leading economic analyses.

# Myth 10: “We Can Adapt Without Reducing Emissions”

**Fact:** **Adaptation alone cannot prevent catastrophic climate risks.** Building seawalls or installing air conditioners only treats symptoms. Without rapid emissions cuts, tipping points like Amazon rainforest dieback and Antarctic ice melt become inevitable, threatening billions with displacement and economic collapse.

I'm having a stressful Tuesday and would welcome some distraction, hence turning to Reddit to hopefully make some new connections. 



I'm originally from Ireland but have lived in multiple countries over the last few years and am now settled in the DC area.

Yes, I love potatoes. No, I don't know your friend/cousin Liam. Yes, I have heard of the town where your ancestors are from.



I moved to the States about 5 years ago and am very settled here but it is very much the place I live as opposed to home. I'm a pretty active person - I hike and cycle a lot. I like to travel and have been to more countries than I can count, both for work and pleasure. At the same time, I enjoy taking the time to watch TV and movies, I am always reading a book or two. Ultimately, I just try to be mindful of my time and put thought into whatever it is I am doing. I think time is a non-renewable resource so I do my best not to waste it.  I love to cook and bake. If you are someone who enjoys chocolate cake or fresh bread, I’ve definitely got you covered. And you haven’t lived until you’ve had my roast potatoes. Coincidentally, the most Irish thing about me is how much I love potatoes. I work in climate change, so I am either perpetuating a hoax or helping save the world. 



This definitely feels a bit like shouting into the void so no expectations of what may come from this post. Ultimately, I would just like to build a connection.

Hi all! I'm having a stressful Tuesday and would welcome some distraction, hence turning to Reddit to hopefully make some new connections. 



I'm originally from Ireland but have lived in multiple countries over the last few years and am now settled in the DC area.  to answer some questions I've gotten over the years: , I still have the accent. No, I am not always drunk. , I can make soda bread. No, I've never caught a leprechaun. , I love potatoes. No, I 't know your friend/cousin Liam. , I have heard of the town where your ancestors are from.



I moved to the States about 5 years ago and am very settled here but it is very much the place I live as opposed to home. I'm a pretty active person - I hike and cycle a lot. I like to travel and have been to more countries than I can count, both for work and pleasure. At the same time, I enjoy taking the time to watch TV and movies, I am always reading a book or two. Ultimately, I  try to be mindful of my time and put thought into whatever it is I am doing. I think time is a non-renewable resource so I do my best not to waste it.  I love to cook and bake. If you are someone who enjoys chocolate cake or fresh bread, I’ve definitely got you covered. And you haven’t lived until you’ve had my roast potatoes. Coincidentally, the most Irish thing about me is how much I love potatoes. I work in climate change, so I am either perpetuating a  or helping save the world.

>It's literally just black people. Like I'm not even trying to be ridiculous but if you control for demographics its pretty clear. It's why this is so misleading.
>>“Black people don’t count!”  How about we factor in poverty, education, social services, and incredibly lax gun laws too instead of just removing black peoples from the stats.
>>>Culture issue. We’ve glorified the gangster lifestyle then are shocked kids are trying to sell crack and carry guns.
>>>>Ah yes, ""culture"" as an answer.  Culture is not a reason for anything. Culture is bred. Ghettos, access to housing, access to education, access to work, those things are controlled and influenced by the goverment. Institutionalized racism. All through American history. 
 Expecting a person to scpace the ghetto and make it by himself (like 1 in a thousand does) is like expecting a drug addict to magically stop doing drugs (like 1 in a thousand does) 
 But sure, it's easier to think it's some sort of cultural thing.  (i'm a white european, before you try to play that card).

[I don't know a good way to phrase this, but what's the non-racist explanation for why all the cities in the US are ""black cities""?](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1kwjj9r/comparing_usa_and_europe/muhux9a/)
>European here, so I guess I can talk more freely. While the whites were accumulating wealth (in financial, cultural, and social terms) for centuries, the blacks didn't. Even if racial discrimination stopped completely right now, you'd still have a different social profile in black communities, and it would take decades before that would even out. This is not because of the present, it's because of the sedimented inequality of the past.
So, the issue isn't really race right now, it's sedimented inequality. But because you guys in the US are fuc*ing brainwashed, you prefer talking about race so that you don't get accused of communism.
>>And yet the poorest populations of any other race don’t commit violent crimes anywhere close to the same rate. Weird.
>>>Not going to go into it but if you have this mindset you have a lot to learn
>>>>How is it a mindset? It’s just a factual statement.
>>>>>Orange fan mad.

[Just imagine if the US didn't have guns to defend themselves with - that murder rate would be so much higher!!!  /s obviously...](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1kwjj9r/comparing_usa_and_europe/muhqtjr/)
>If that was the only reason Finland, serbia and Austria death per capita should be higher but it's smaller than France.
>>That is because gun ownership is an incredibly simple and convenient scapegoat for those who desire to ignore (or maybe cannot comprehend) the complex societal issues that infect USA deep to its core.  For reference, the number of gun owners in Switzerland is somewhere between 25-30%, compared to 32% in USA.
>>>If gun ownership was illegal you would still have less deaths. How many people do you think you can kill with a gun in the same timeframe as knife?The fatality rate of a gunshot compared to a knife wound? The ability of bystanders to disarm a gunman vs knife-wielder. The ability of police with guns to confront a gunman vs a knife-wielder.
>>>>Australia disproved this with their gun ban. After the ban the trend in the homicide rate did not chang

>How many cities are run by Republicans?  Even odder, 8 out of 10 are in deep red states with incredibly lax gun laws. Almost as if it’s intentional.
>>None of the cities in the list are run by Republicans. Yes 8/10 have Republicans as governor, yet once outside of Jackson MS for example, the crime rates drop significantly. Many to the national average. This pattern continues for each of the cities listed. Which seems to highlight that local policies are much likely to be the cause.
>>>Or that them being a big city is the cause . New York is incredibly low and yet run bh Democrats so your logic is flawed.
>>>>New York was very high until recently when national spotlight was on the city. At any point it becomes necessary for the National Guard to be deployed to combat crime that is a major indicator that policies have failed.
>>>>>Any proof to back up your insane claim ? the last time the Nationnal guard was deployed was to remplace prison guard yhat were on strike. Distributing meal and medication to inmate being done by the Nationnal guard is not why NY got saffer. also no NY was not very high , the murder rate it was 4.5 in 2010 and 4.2 in 2020.

>Sucks so bad that people pay to get smuggled in.
>>Europeans don’t
>>>They do. So do Asians and Africans. How often do South and Central Americans show up at European borders asking for asylum?  There's probably a reason that refugees from all over the world skip the much easier and safer route to Europe, and opt instead to travel to Mexico to make their way into the US. If you're European, instead of taking the easy cheap shot at America's flaws, a little self-reflection might be a good idea.
>>>>You realize how fucking dumb you sound? “How often do south and Central Americans CROSS THE ATLANTIC asking for asylum”  So dumb.

>Because these statistics are primarily gang violence driven, it doesn't resonate with the rest of the population because the vast majority never see it
>>Same for all the school shootings?
>>>Those numbers wouldn't be anywhere near as dramatic, the city thing wouldn't work. You can only cherry pick really high murder rates when the murder rates are really high, and they're high because of gang violence.
>>>>Why is there no gang violence in Europe?
>>>>>Hmm ? Says who ?

>Propaganda. It's much easier to pretend this happens ""because guns"" than to actually address the complex socioeconomic issues that cause high levels of violence in certain areas.  There are counties in the United States with more guns than entire countries in Europe, yet their murder rates are exactly 0. Guns aren't the problem. They never will be the problem, and no amount of intellectual dishonesty will change that.  And so here we are. Lazy, anti-gun politicians point the blame at guns instead of their own racist and classist policies, useful idiots eat it up, and nothing gets done.
>>So you’re saying the answer to this violence is… more guns?
>>>I'm saying there are places all over the country where guns are prevalent, and homicide is rare. What are they doing that these cities aren't?
>>>>I’d guess at poverty.  Guns make violence incredibly easy, it’s just a trigger pull. It takes a second of rage, a moment of confusion, misjudging a situation, and someone dies. Guns are empowering and an equaliser (to borrow the new word Trump invented) in an unequal society. If someone needs a gun to feel safe or in control then they have a psychological dependency. It’s not healthy.  Guns are absolutely a problem.

[@Americans, this is why we roll our eyes when you start defending your gun laws.](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1kwjj9r/comparing_usa_and_europe/muhrknl/)
>I promise you, most of this is done by people using illegal weapons.
>>I promise you, something about how you think about guns is still the cause of this. Figure it out yourself.
>>>It’s not the cause at all. It’s the culture in the areas. Look up those cities and research their population makeup/financial situation and I guarantee you that you’ll find your answer.

>European here, so I guess I can talk more freely. While the whites were accumulating wealth (in financial, cultural, and social terms) for centuries, the blacks didn't. Even if racial discrimination stopped completely right now, you'd still have a different social profile in black communities, and it would take decades before that would even out. This is not because of the present, it's because of the sedimented inequality of the past.
So, the issue isn't really race right now, it's sedimented inequality. But because you guys in the US are fuc*ing brainwashed, you prefer talking about race so that you don't get accused of communism.

>>>If gun ownership was illegal you would still have less deaths. How many people do you think you can kill with a gun in the same timeframe as knife?The fatality rate of a gunshot compared to a knife wound?

>How many cities are run by Republicans?  Even odder, 8 out of 10 are in deep red states with incredibly lax gun laws. Almost as if it’s intentional.
>>None of the cities in the list are run by Republicans. Yes 8/10 have Republicans as governor, yet once outside of Jackson MS for example, the crime rates drop significantly. Many to the national average. This pattern continues for each of the cities listed. Which seems to highlight that local policies are much likely to be the cause.

So, the issue isn't really race right now, it's sedimented inequality. But because you guys in the US are fuc*ing brainwashed, you prefer talking about race so that you don't get accused of communism.

>Propaganda. It's much easier to pretend this happens ""because guns"" than to actually address the complex socioeconomic issues that cause high levels of violence in certain areas.  There are counties in the United States with more guns than entire countries in Europe, yet their murder rates are exactly 0. Guns aren't the problem. They never will be the problem, and no amount of intellectual dishonesty will change that.  And so here we are. Lazy, anti-gun politicians point the blame at guns instead of their own racist and classist policies, useful idiots eat it up, and nothing gets done.
>>So you’re saying the answer to this violence is… more guns?
>>>I'm saying there are places all over the country where guns are prevalent, and homicide is rare. What are they doing that these cities aren't?
>>>>I’d guess at poverty.  Guns make violence incredibly easy, it’s just a trigger pull. It takes a second of rage, a moment of confusion, misjudging a situation, and someone dies. Guns are empowering and an equaliser (to borrow the new word Trump invented) in an unequal society. If someone needs a gun to feel safe or in control then they have a psychological dependency. It’s not healthy.  Guns are absolutely a problem.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/pMoIxxImoP): **October 28, 2020**

I ran away from home when I was 16. My family was (and is) incredibly toxic. My father was verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive, my mother enabled him and was mentally abusive in her own right. I was forced to work full time in addition to going to school because I was expected to pay rent in addition to ""repayment"" of money spent on taking care of me as a kid.

I'm not proud of it, but I started hiding some of my tips and lying about how much I made when my father asked for his payments. Eventually the owner of the restaurant where I worked offered to let me live in the apartment upstairs for very cheap in exchange for some extra sidework. I agreed and I moved out one night in secret.

There was an awful blowup and my father showed up at the restaurant and demanded to know where I was. Thankfully the hostess and another waitress knew everything and told him I quit and they didn't know where I was.

I haven't spoken to my father since the night I left home. He knows I'm alive and well because I called my mother and I know she told him. I wouldn’t tell her where I was staying, just that I was ok and wasn't coming back. I waited until I was sure I could make it on my own to let her know.

The one person I stayed in touch with was my younger brother. We emailed at first and then texted (once he got a phone) several times a week. I wouldn’t say we were super close or anything, but closer than anyone else in the family. I felt guilty about leaving him behind with my parents and our equally abusive older sister (23/F) who still lives at home with them.

My father was always worse to my brother. Maybe because he was the only boy so he could take it, I don't know. But he was terrible to him. I am convinced he drove him to suicide.

A little over a year ago, my brother took his own life. It gutted me. I tried to be there for him and support him as best I could but I work all the time and just. I wish I could have done more. I feel like I failed him.

I found out from my mother. She called me from his phone the morning after they found him. I also found out that my father was just going to abandon him at the morgue and let him be buried by the county. I couldn't do that to him.

So I called a funeral home and arranged for him to be creamated. I took his ashes and scattered them on the beach where we used to go fishing together. I think it's what he would have wanted.

My father is angry though. Really angry.

I paid for my brother's cremation with a credit card. It was $6,000.00 and I don't really have the money to spare but it was important. It's going to take years to pay it all off but he was worth that to me.

But that isn't how my father sees it.

He somehow has this crazy idea that I had a million dollar life insurance policy on my brother and that I'm rich now.

He and my sister have been showing up at the restaurant where I used to work and demanding to see me. The owner keeps calling me and telling me about it. I've called the cops but they won't do anything unless the owner wants to charge them with trespassing.

I called my mother and tried to talk some sense into her but she believes this insane story about life insurance and now she thinks I killed my brother to collect the insurance money.

My sister keeps calling me from different phone numbers and leaving awful threatening messages demanding her ""cut"" of the money I don't freaking have.

They are all crazy and hurtful and I am worried this is going to get worse.

What can I do?

Tl;Dr: My brother died. I paid to have him cremated. Now my family thinks I got insurance money and they won't leave me alone.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Your boss is great...but he's going to fire you soon. Your father is just like a rotting disease that destroys everything he touches. You have to get out of your area ASAP. Talk to your boss, come up with a plan that gets you as far away as possible...across the country if necessary. Ask if your boss will give you a good reference,

Then just leave. Look up youth hostels in an area where there are lots of jobs. Apply at any job possible to get on your feet. You don't have to put up with this stalking and abuse. But if the police are not doing their job than running TOWARDS a new life is the best option. Good luck, I know you are a survivor and will achieve miracles.

> **OOP:** That description of my father hits home. You're right. They aren't just going to move on and let me go. I wish I could convince them there isn't any money and to just let me live my life. I don't even think I could have gotten life insurance on my brother if I wanted to.
> 
> Leaving will be scary but I think you're right. I think I have to.

**Did OOP's parents know where she lives now?**

> **OOP:** They know where I used to work and who my friends are. They have harassed people I know a few times. I still live above the restaurant but I don't work there anymore. Utilities and stuff are in my landlord's name.

**Commenter 2:** Maybe it’s time to seek out a lawyer and get a restraining order. These people are insane.

**Commenter 3:** I am so awfully sorry you have to go trough this! You did right by your brother and that makes you an awesome sibling. I hope you know that you did the right thing.

I'm so incredibly sorry your family is harassing you like that and I really hope you're in a safe place where they can't reach you. Please talk to someone you trust about your situation, this is an awful burden to carry alone. Your family wouldn't have a right to get a 'cut' even if you had taken out a life insurance. You don't owe them anything and you deserve to live a peaceful life and keep your sanity. I wish you all the best and hope you can leave this horrible situation soon ♡.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/0B4VOdBPsI): **January 4, 2021 (2.5 months later)** 

It's been a while. A LOT has happened, some good some bad. I am prepared for a lot of ""I told you so""s. Also more ""This is fake!"" DMs. But so many people wrote to me over the holiday and offered support and asked about me and my situation that I wanted to post an update.

First of all, thank you to everyone who replied to my last post. It means a lot to me that so many people cared. The advice and support I received was really desperately needed. I didn't know how much. Honestly when I posted I was hoping for some kind of magic answer that would get my unreasonable family to just listen to me. What I got was much more.

I guess I couldn't see just how blind I was to certain people in my life. My mother especially. I always labeled her (in my head) as ""the good parent"". She and I always had a somewhat ok relationship even if she let my father do all kinds of awful things. Even after she started accusing me of killing my brother for money I kept hoping she would snap out of it if I could just convince her of how life insurance works. But a lot of the comments made me realize she really is an enabler herself and that I really did need to cut ties and move on. That was so, so hard for me. I didn't want to think that I'd never be able to see my parents or my sister again, not even for Christmas. I know there's a lot of bad in what they've done, but there were good times, too. Times I will always miss.

So many people offered kindness and support. I couldn't allow myself to accept any monetary donations that were offered but I do appreciate the gesture. One especially kind and amazing redditor offered me something I couldn't turn down. They helped me get a job at the company they worked for in a new state. Without their help, I don't know if I'd be here to post this update. I won't call them out, but they know how grateful I am.

Ok, on to the actual update.

As I mentioned, I have a new job. It's better than what I was doing and it has some great benefits attached. It's in a new state, where I am now, along with a new roommate and her kitty. Uprooting myself and finding a place to live in a pandemic was challenging but my roommate has been awesome and very understanding. She knows my situation and won't let anyone claiming to be family inside, if they should somehow manage to find me. Everything is in her name that can be and she's happy to keep it that way to help keep me safe.

I figured things out with my new employer, who allowed me to do almost everything related to interviewing and screening online so I knew I'd have a job waiting for me. I also found my new roommate online and we FaceTimed a bunch so we knew we'd get along when I got there. She even picked me up and helped me get settled.

When I told my landlord and former boss I'd be leaving for good, she was sad but happy for me. She waived my last month's rent and even gave me a Christmas card with some cash in it to help me start my new life.

But it wasn't all good. I made a mistake and I know a lot of you warned me about it.

I could not leave without saying goodbye. Plus, I needed something to remember my brother by. He had a huge collection of old band shirts and I wanted just one of them. I knew my mother hadn't touched his room (""saving evidence for the investigation"" she said) so I knew she would have one. I called her up and told her I wanted to see her. I told her that I wanted to have dinner with her and her alone and she agreed not to tell my father or my sister about it. I told her I wanted one of his shirts and she agreed to bring one for me. I told her I was leaving town and that I wanted to say goodbye for closure and because it was Christmas which was always such a special time for her and me.

I wanted to meet somewhere in public so I picked a restaurant we had been to before that I knew she liked. I got there early and watched her come in so I knew she was really alone before she sat down.

We had a really nice meal together. She seemed to have actually changed her mind about my father's crazy allegations. We talked about my brother. I told her where I'd scattered his ashes in case she wanted to visit with him.

When it came time to leave, I paid the bill and asked about the shirt. She told me she left it in the car so it didn't get stains on it. She had been so nice and friendly that dinner that I trusted her. I went with her to the parking lot to get my brother's shirt out of the car for me.

My father was waiting there for us. And he had a gun.

As soon as I saw him, I screamed as loud as I could and ran. I went back inside the restaurant and yelled that there was a man after me and he had a gun. He barged in screaming and I ran off into the bathroom and locked myself in. I called the police and I waited in there with the dispatcher on the phone until they came and got him.

I pressed charges and so did the restaurant.

My mother lied about the shirt. I should have known she would. That is my biggest regret I think because showing up there like that was really the push I needed to finally cut all of them out of my life for good. I am sad that I have nothing to remember my brother by, but I like to think he's looking over me.

I now have an order of protection. I changed my number and deleted all my social media. And I am thinking of changing my name, too. Maybe taking my brother's first name as my surname as a way to honor him by.

I hope 2021 can be my year.

**TL;DR I didn't listen when people told me to cut all contact. My father was arrested. I moved away and started a new life**

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Holy crap..... I wish the best for your new life. Later in life years and years in the future when she finds you and reaches out claiming she’s changed. Remember the moment she sat and had dinner with you knowing she’d trick you into a situation where you could have been killed. Protect yourself and NEVER interact with these people again.

**Commenter 2:** Changing your name will give you a whole new level of living life - I chose my true name nearly 8 years ago and it's been one helluva ride.

I just wanted to say, if you do ahead with it, I think it's beautiful of you to use your brother's name as part of your identity.

2021's gonna bring a few new challenges so take your time and brace yourself for some crazy times ahead... In the meantime, you embrace your dreams and yourself. You're gonna be amazing. Hell, you already are 💛

**Commenter 3:** Good lord. The amount you've been through so young us atrocious.

I would suggest trauma counselling as a start. Are there charities in your area you could look up?

Honestly though, I'm astonished by your bravery, courage and resilience. Put your faith in those who deserve it. You haven't given up and to me that is quite incredible. Remember that OP, in your darkest times you've fought tooth and nail. I'm sure your brother would be proud of you for putting your father where he belongs and that you are safe. I'm so sorry you couldn't get something to remember him by.

Times are shit right now, but you're not alone. People care.

Best of luck OP

[Update #2 - Four Years Later](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/6snGIDRh3U): **June 2, 2025 (4 years and 5 months later)**

Hi Reddit. It's been a while and I honestly forgot about this site entirely. I dont use any social media or anything so I'm not really in the habit of keeping up with these things. But Reddit sent an email about a privacy update and reminded me about it so I thought I would share an update in case anyone still cares.

The past 4 years have been a lot of growth for me. I did change my name as some suggested. I didn't end up taking my brother's name out of fear of linking me to my former family and making it easier for them to find me. I did want a connection though so I took the (fairly common) last name of his favorite singer as my last name and a first name I've always loved and wanted to name a daughter someday.

My roommate was amazing, she got married last year and moved out with her now husband. I still see them occasionally as friends. She let me keep the apartment and I also ended up with her kitty because he liked me better and her husband is mildly allergic. So we're besties now, facing the world together.

I ended up leaving the job that kind redditor helped set me up with after 2 years. I found a much better role closer to the apartment. It pays better and I can walk to work. I'd call it a win.

I know everyone is wondering if there has been more family drama but luckily there hasn't really. I haven't heard from any of them since I left. I am waiting for it though and trying my best to make sure it can't ever happen.

I do wish I had something left of my brother's. He'd be 20 now, the same age I was when all of this went down. It still hurts to know he won't ever be 20, or 30, or anything else. I wish I had kept a piece of him or maybe had some of his ashes made into a necklace or something just to have him with me. Everything happened so fast and I never thought I'd end up leaving home so I always thought I'd just be able to go visit our beach if I wanted to talk to him at all. But I guess that's the trade off.

I don't date at all. I really keep pretty much to myself at least for now. I don't think I can trust people enough to get close. I am in therapy and it's helping.

Things are honestly pretty good right now. I just wanted everyone who wondered to know that. So many kind people offered support and advice and opened my eyes to realities I wasn't ready to recognize. I might not be here if not for them, especially the person who put me in touch with resources and helped me find a new job. I owe my new life to them, so thank you.

**Commenter 1:** I'm genuinely flabbergasted by how much you've overcome, your grit and gorgeous spirit shine through these words, leaving me starry-eyed and rooting for you more than ever.

**Commenter 2:** Sweetheart your brother will always be with you, he's in your heart. Sending you love and good thoughts, and make sure that you have the life that your brother would have wanted for you.

**Commenter 3:** You mentioned ""our beach"". I assume you don’t want to visit it in fear of being recognised, but could you have someone else get you a bit of sand, a pebble or a shell in memory of your brother?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/pMoIxxImoP): **October 28, 2020**

I ran away from home when I was 16. My family was (and is) incredibly toxic. My father was verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive, my mother enabled him and was mentally abusive in her own right. I was forced to work full time in addition to going to school because I was expected to pay rent in addition to ""repayment"" of money spent on taking care of me as a kid.

I'm not proud of it, but I started hiding some of my tips and lying about how much I made when my father asked for his payments. Eventually the owner of the restaurant where I worked offered to let me live in the apartment upstairs for very cheap in exchange for some extra sidework. I agreed and I moved out one night in secret.

There was an awful blowup and my father showed up at the restaurant and demanded to know where I was. Thankfully the hostess and another waitress knew everything and told him I quit and they didn't know where I was.

I haven't spoken to my father since the night I left home. He knows I'm alive and well because I called my mother and I know she told him. I wouldn’t tell her where I was staying, just that I was ok and wasn't coming back. I waited until I was sure I could make it on my own to let her know.

The one person I stayed in touch with was my younger brother. We emailed at first and then texted (once he got a phone) several times a week. I wouldn’t say we were super close or anything, but closer than anyone else in the family. I felt guilty about leaving him behind with my parents and our equally abusive older sister (23/F) who still lives at home with them.

My father was always worse to my brother. Maybe because he was the only boy so he could take it, I don't know. But he was terrible to him. I am convinced he drove him to suicide.

A little over a year ago, my brother took his own life. It gutted me. I tried to be there for him and support him as best I could but I work all the time and just. I wish I could have done more. I feel like I failed him.

I found out from my mother. She called me from his phone the morning after they found him. I also found out that my father was just going to abandon him at the morgue and let him be buried by the county. I couldn't do that to him.

So I called a funeral home and arranged for him to be creamated. I took his ashes and scattered them on the beach where we used to go fishing together. I think it's what he would have wanted.

My father is angry though. Really angry.

I paid for my brother's cremation with a credit card. It was $6,000.00 and I don't really have the money to spare but it was important. It's going to take years to pay it all off but he was worth that to me.

But that isn't how my father sees it.

He somehow has this crazy idea that I had a million dollar life insurance policy on my brother and that I'm rich now.

He and my sister have been showing up at the restaurant where I used to work and demanding to see me. The owner keeps calling me and telling me about it. I've called the cops but they won't do anything unless the owner wants to charge them with trespassing.

I called my mother and tried to talk some sense into her but she believes this insane story about life insurance and now she thinks I killed my brother to collect the insurance money.

My sister keeps calling me from different phone numbers and leaving awful threatening messages demanding her ""cut"" of the money I don't freaking have.

They are all crazy and hurtful and I am worried this is going to get worse.

What can I do?

Tl;Dr: My brother died. I paid to have him cremated. Now my family thinks I got insurance money and they won't leave me alone.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Your boss is great...but he's going to fire you soon. Your father is just like a rotting disease that destroys everything he touches. You have to get out of your area ASAP. Talk to your boss, come up with a plan that gets you as far away as possible...across the country if necessary. Ask if your boss will give you a good reference,

Then just leave. Look up youth hostels in an area where there are lots of jobs. Apply at any job possible to get on your feet. You don't have to put up with this stalking and abuse. But if the police are not doing their job than running TOWARDS a new life is the best option. Good luck, I know you are a survivor and will achieve miracles.

> **OOP:** That description of my father hits home. You're right. They aren't just going to move on and let me go. I wish I could convince them there isn't any money and to just let me live my life. I don't even think I could have gotten life insurance on my brother if I wanted to.
> 
> Leaving will be scary but I think you're right. I think I have to.

**Did OOP's parents know where she lives now?**

> **OOP:** They know where I used to work and who my friends are. They have harassed people I know a few times. I still live above the restaurant but I don't work there anymore. Utilities and stuff are in my landlord's name.

**Commenter 2:** Maybe it’s time to seek out a lawyer and get a restraining order. These people are insane.

**Commenter 3:** I am so awfully sorry you have to go trough this! You did right by your brother and that makes you an awesome sibling. I hope you know that you did the right thing.

I'm so incredibly sorry your family is harassing you like that and I really hope you're in a safe place where they can't reach you. Please talk to someone you trust about your situation, this is an awful burden to carry alone. Your family wouldn't have a right to get a 'cut' even if you had taken out a life insurance. You don't owe them anything and you deserve to live a peaceful life and keep your sanity. I wish you all the best and hope you can leave this horrible situation soon ♡.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/0B4VOdBPsI): **January 4, 2021 (2.5 months later)** 

It's been a while. A LOT has happened, some good some bad. I am prepared for a lot of ""I told you so""s. Also more ""This is fake!"" DMs. But so many people wrote to me over the holiday and offered support and asked about me and my situation that I wanted to post an update.

First of all, thank you to everyone who replied to my last post. It means a lot to me that so many people cared. The advice and support I received was really desperately needed. I didn't know how much. Honestly when I posted I was hoping for some kind of magic answer that would get my unreasonable family to just listen to me. What I got was much more.

I guess I couldn't see just how blind I was to certain people in my life. My mother especially. I always labeled her (in my head) as ""the good parent"". She and I always had a somewhat ok relationship even if she let my father do all kinds of awful things. Even after she started accusing me of killing my brother for money I kept hoping she would snap out of it if I could just convince her of how life insurance works. But a lot of the comments made me realize she really is an enabler herself and that I really did need to cut ties and move on. That was so, so hard for me. I didn't want to think that I'd never be able to see my parents or my sister again, not even for Christmas. I know there's a lot of bad in what they've done, but there were good times, too. Times I will always miss.

So many people offered kindness and support. I couldn't allow myself to accept any monetary donations that were offered but I do appreciate the gesture. One especially kind and amazing redditor offered me something I couldn't turn down. They helped me get a job at the company they worked for in a new state. Without their help, I don't know if I'd be here to post this update. I won't call them out, but they know how grateful I am.

Ok, on to the actual update.

As I mentioned, I have a new job. It's better than what I was doing and it has some great benefits attached. It's in a new state, where I am now, along with a new roommate and her kitty. Uprooting myself and finding a place to live in a pandemic was challenging but my roommate has been awesome and very understanding. She knows my situation and won't let anyone claiming to be family inside, if they should somehow manage to find me. Everything is in her name that can be and she's happy to keep it that way to help keep me safe.

I figured things out with my new employer, who allowed me to do almost everything related to interviewing and screening online so I knew I'd have a job waiting for me. I also found my new roommate online and we FaceTimed a bunch so we knew we'd get along when I got there. She even picked me up and helped me get settled.

When I told my landlord and former boss I'd be leaving for good, she was sad but happy for me. She waived my last month's rent and even gave me a Christmas card with some cash in it to help me start my new life.

But it wasn't all good. I made a mistake and I know a lot of you warned me about it.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/pMoIxxImoP): **October 28, 2020**

I ran away from home when I was 16. My family was (and is) incredibly toxic. My father was verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive, my mother enabled him and was mentally abusive in her own right. I was forced to work full time in addition to going to school because I was expected to pay rent in addition to ""repayment"" of money spent on taking care of me as a kid.

I'm not proud of it, but I started hiding some of my tips and lying about how much I made when my father asked for his payments. Eventually the owner of the restaurant where I worked offered to let me live in the apartment upstairs for very cheap in exchange for some extra sidework. I agreed and I moved out one night in secret.

There was an awful blowup and my father showed up at the restaurant and demanded to know where I was. Thankfully the hostess and another waitress knew everything and told him I quit and they didn't know where I was.

I haven't spoken to my father since the night I left home. He knows I'm alive and well because I called my mother and I know she told him. I wouldn’t tell her where I was staying, just that I was ok and wasn't coming back. I waited until I was sure I could make it on my own to let her know.

The one person I stayed in touch with was my younger brother. We emailed at first and then texted (once he got a phone) several times a week. I wouldn’t say we were super close or anything, but closer than anyone else in the family. I felt guilty about leaving him behind with my parents and our equally abusive older sister (23/F) who still lives at home with them.

My father was always worse to my brother. Maybe because he was the only boy so he could take it, I don't know. But he was terrible to him. I am convinced he drove him to suicide.

A little over a year ago, my brother took his own life. It gutted me. I tried to be there for him and support him as best I could but I work all the time and just. I wish I could have done more. I feel like I failed him.

I found out from my mother. She called me from his phone the morning after they found him. I also found out that my father was just going to abandon him at the morgue and let him be buried by the county. I couldn't do that to him.

So I called a funeral home and arranged for him to be creamated. I took his ashes and scattered them on the beach where we used to go fishing together. I think it's what he would have wanted.

My father is angry though. Really angry.

I paid for my brother's cremation with a credit card. It was $6,000.00 and I don't really have the money to spare but it was important. It's going to take years to pay it all off but he was worth that to me.

But that isn't how my father sees it.

He somehow has this crazy idea that I had a million dollar life insurance policy on my brother and that I'm rich now.

He and my sister have been showing up at the restaurant where I used to work and demanding to see me. The owner keeps calling me and telling me about it. I've called the cops but they won't do anything unless the owner wants to charge them with trespassing.

I called my mother and tried to talk some sense into her but she believes this insane story about life insurance and now she thinks I killed my brother to collect the insurance money.

My sister keeps calling me from different phone numbers and leaving awful threatening messages demanding her ""cut"" of the money I don't freaking have.

They are all crazy and hurtful and I am worried this is going to get worse.

What can I do?

Tl;Dr: My brother died. I paid to have him cremated. Now my family thinks I got insurance money and they won't leave me alone.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Your boss is great...but he's going to fire you soon. Your father is just like a rotting disease that destroys everything he touches. You have to get out of your area ASAP. Talk to your boss, come up with a plan that gets you as far away as possible...across the country if necessary. Ask if your boss will give you a good reference,

Then just leave. Look up youth hostels in an area where there are lots of jobs. Apply at any job possible to get on your feet. You don't have to put up with this stalking and abuse. But if the police are not doing their job than running TOWARDS a new life is the best option. Good luck, I know you are a survivor and will achieve miracles.

> **OOP:** That description of my father hits home. You're right. They aren't just going to move on and let me go. I wish I could convince them there isn't any money and to just let me live my life. I don't even think I could have gotten life insurance on my brother if I wanted to.
> 
> Leaving will be scary but I think you're right. I think I have to.

**Did OOP's parents know where she lives now?**

> **OOP:** They know where I used to work and who my friends are. They have harassed people I know a few times. I still live above the restaurant but I don't work there anymore. Utilities and stuff are in my landlord's name.

**Commenter 2:** Maybe it’s time to seek out a lawyer and get a restraining order. These people are insane.

**Commenter 3:** I am so awfully sorry you have to go trough this! You did right by your brother and that makes you an awesome sibling. I hope you know that you did the right thing.

I'm so incredibly sorry your family is harassing you like that and I really hope you're in a safe place where they can't reach you. Please talk to someone you trust about your situation, this is an awful burden to carry alone. Your family wouldn't have a right to get a 'cut' even if you had taken out a life insurance. You don't owe them anything and you deserve to live a peaceful life and keep your sanity. I wish you all the best and hope you can leave this horrible situation soon ♡.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/0B4VOdBPsI): **January 4, 2021 (2.5 months later)** 

It's been a while. A LOT has happened, some good some bad. I am prepared for a lot of ""I told you so""s. Also more ""This is fake!"" DMs. But so many people wrote to me over the holiday and offered support and asked about me and my situation that I wanted to post an update.

First of all, thank you to everyone who replied to my last post. It means a lot to me that so many people cared. The advice and support I received was really desperately needed. I didn't know how much. Honestly when I posted I was hoping for some kind of magic answer that would get my unreasonable family to just listen to me. What I got was much more.

I guess I couldn't see just how blind I was to certain people in my life. My mother especially. I always labeled her (in my head) as ""the good parent"". She and I always had a somewhat ok relationship even if she let my father do all kinds of awful things. Even after she started accusing me of killing my brother for money I kept hoping she would snap out of it if I could just convince her of how life insurance works. But a lot of the comments made me realize she really is an enabler herself and that I really did need to cut ties and move on. That was so, so hard for me. I didn't want to think that I'd never be able to see my parents or my sister again, not even for Christmas. I know there's a lot of bad in what they've done, but there were good times, too. Times I will always miss.

So many people offered kindness and support. I couldn't allow myself to accept any monetary donations that were offered but I do appreciate the gesture. One especially kind and amazing redditor offered me something I couldn't turn down. They helped me get a job at the company they worked for in a new state. Without their help, I don't know if I'd be here to post this update. I won't call them out, but they know how grateful I am.

Ok, on to the actual update.

As I mentioned, I have a new job. It's better than what I was doing and it has some great benefits attached. It's in a new state, where I am now, along with a new roommate and her kitty. Uprooting myself and finding a place to live in a pandemic was challenging but my roommate has been awesome and very understanding. She knows my situation and won't let anyone claiming to be family inside, if they should somehow manage to find me. Everything is in her name that can be and she's happy to keep it that way to help keep me safe.

I figured things out with my new employer, who allowed me to do almost everything related to interviewing and screening online so I knew I'd have a job waiting for me. I also found my new roommate online and we FaceTimed a bunch so we knew we'd get along when I got there. She even picked me up and helped me get settled.

When I told my landlord and former boss I'd be leaving for good, she was sad but happy for me. She waived my last month's rent and even gave me a Christmas card with some cash in it to help me start my new life.

But it wasn't all good. I made a mistake and I know a lot of you warned me about it.

I could not leave without saying goodbye. Plus, I needed something to remember my brother by. He had a huge collection of old band shirts and I wanted just one of them. I knew my mother hadn't touched his room (""saving evidence for the investigation"" she said) so I knew she would have one. I called her up and told her I wanted to see her. I told her that I wanted to have dinner with her and her alone and she agreed not to tell my father or my sister about it. I told her I wanted one of his shirts and she agreed to bring one for me. I told her I was leaving town and that I wanted to say goodbye for closure and because it was Christmas which was always such a special time for her and me.

I wanted to meet somewhere in public so I picked a restaurant we had been to before that I knew she liked. I got there early and watched her come in so I knew she was really alone before she sat down.

We had a really nice meal together. She seemed to have actually changed her mind about my father's crazy allegations. We talked about my brother. I told her where I'd scattered his ashes in case she wanted to visit with him.

When it came time to leave, I paid the bill and asked about the shirt. She told me she left it in the car so it didn't get stains on it. She had been so nice and friendly that dinner that I trusted her. I went with her to the parking lot to get my brother's shirt out of the car for me.

My father was waiting there for us. And he had a gun.

As soon as I  him, I screamed as loud as I could and ran. I went back inside the restaurant and yelled that there was a man after me and he had a gun. He barged in screaming and I ran off into the bathroom and locked myself in. I called the police and I waited in there with the dispatcher on the phone until they came and got him.

I pressed charges and so did the restaurant.

My mother lied about the shirt. I should have known she would. That is my biggest regret I think because showing up there like that was really the push I needed to finally cut all of them out of my life for good. I am sad that I have nothing to remember my brother by, but I like to think he's looking over me.

I now have an order of protection. I changed my number and deleted all my social media. And I am thinking of changing my name, too. Maybe taking my brother's first name as my surname as a way to honor him by.

I hope 2021 can be my year.

**TL;DR I didn't listen when people told me to cut all contact. My father was arrested. I moved away and started a new life**

**Editor's note: OOP did not leave any comments for the update, but sharing some of top comments**

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Holy crap..... I wish the best for your new life. Later in life years and years in the future when she finds you and reaches out claiming she’s changed. Remember the moment she sat and had dinner with you knowing she’d trick you into a situation where you could have been killed. Protect yourself and NEVER interact with these people again.

**Commenter 2:** Changing your name will give you a whole new level of living life - I chose my true name nearly 8 years ago and it's been one helluva ride.

I just wanted to say, if you do ahead with it, I think it's beautiful of you to use your brother's name as part of your identity.

2021's gonna bring a few new challenges so take your time and brace yourself for some crazy times ahead... In the meantime, you embrace your dreams and yourself. You're gonna be amazing. Hell, you already are 💛

**Commenter 3:** Good lord. The amount you've been through so young us atrocious.

I would suggest trauma counselling as a start. Are there charities in your area you could look up?

Honestly though, I'm astonished by your bravery, courage and resilience. Put your faith in those who deserve it. You haven't given up and to me that is quite incredible. Remember that OP, in your darkest times you've fought tooth and nail. I'm sure your brother would be proud of you for putting your father where he belongs and that you are safe. I'm so sorry you couldn't get something to remember him by.

Times are shit right now, but you're not alone. People care.

Best of luck OP

[Update #2 - Four Years Later](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/6snGIDRh3U): **June 2, 2025 (4 years and 5 months later)**

Hi Reddit. It's been a while and I honestly forgot about this site entirely. I dont use any social media or anything so I'm not really in the habit of keeping up with these things. But Reddit sent an email about a privacy update and reminded me about it so I thought I would share an update in case anyone still cares.

The past 4 years have been a lot of growth for me. I did change my name as some suggested. I didn't end up taking my brother's name out of fear of linking me to my former family and making it easier for them to find me. I did want a connection though so I took the (fairly common) last name of his favorite singer as my last name and a first name I've always loved and wanted to name a daughter someday.

My roommate was amazing, she got married last year and moved out with her now husband. I still see them occasionally as friends. She let me keep the apartment and I also ended up with her kitty because he liked me better and her husband is mildly allergic. So we're besties now, facing the world together.

I ended up leaving the job that kind redditor helped set me up with after 2 years. I found a much better role closer to the apartment. It pays better and I can walk to work. I'd call it a win.

I know everyone is wondering if there has been more family drama but luckily there hasn't really. I haven't heard from any of them since I left. I am waiting for it though and trying my best to make sure it can't ever happen.

I do wish I had something left of my brother's. He'd be 20 now, the same age I was when all of this went down. It still hurts to know he won't ever be 20, or 30, or anything else. I wish I had kept a piece of him or maybe had some of his ashes made into a necklace or something just to have him with me. Everything happened so fast and I never thought I'd end up leaving home so I always thought I'd just be able to go visit our beach if I wanted to talk to him at all. But I guess that's the trade off.

I don't date at all. I really keep pretty much to myself at least for now. I don't think I can trust people enough to get close. I am in therapy and it's helping.

Things are honestly pretty good right now. I just wanted everyone who wondered to know that. So many kind people offered support and advice and opened my eyes to realities I wasn't ready to recognize. I might not be here if not for them, especially the person who put me in touch with resources and helped me find a new job. I owe my new life to them, so thank you.

**Commenter 1:** I'm genuinely flabbergasted by how much you've overcome, your grit and gorgeous spirit shine through these words, leaving me starry-eyed and rooting for you more than ever.

**Commenter 2:** Sweetheart your brother will always be with you, he's in your heart. Sending you love and good thoughts, and make sure that you have the life that your brother would have wanted for you.

**Commenter 3:** You mentioned ""our beach"". I assume you don’t want to visit it in fear of being recognised, but could you have someone else get you a bit of sand, a pebble or a shell in memory of your brother?

Ilunor had remained silent following our spur-of-the-moment sightseeing trip to Acela. 

In fact, all three didn’t have much to say at all until Thalmin finally broke the silence as we snapped back to reality. 

“Emma… although I have described your people as a nation of scholars, it was always meant as a tentative hyperbole. Because while I can understand that such an abundance of information might be necessary for a certain social class of commoners — scholars, scribes, civil servants, and the like — I cannot see how said abundance would be useful for your average commoner.” He posited only to be answered, not by me, but by Thacea.

“It aligns with what Emma had claimed from the onset.” She began. “That there exist no gods or kings, but only the masses. And with that comes the responsibility and the burden of collective rule, facilitated by collective intelligence, which necessitates an abundance of accessible knowledge.” She turned towards me, as if knowing I was ready to tag team off of that statement.

“We all share and chip in, in carrying the burdens that come with civilization. Or more accurately, the responsibilities of maintaining civilization. We all benefit from it too, of course, and much of what you saw was either blatant benefits, or just utilitarian tools in making daily life a little bit easier.” 

Thalmin blinked at that, gesturing at the ZNK-19. “That was somehow an attempt to make life easier?!” 

“Well… it makes things more seamless. Especially as it pertains to stuff like travel, scheduling, and so on and so forth. Beyond that, there’s also the added benefit of having both the compendium of all human knowledge, current events, and the infosphere plus the extranet at your fingertips.” 

I’d lost the prince right about at the last sentence, the man resorting to staring blankly whilst Thacea’s eagle eyes narrowed even further until they were only pinpricks.

“Erm, I shouldn’t get into it right now, but suffice it to say our incorporeal world also comprises a sort of… communications network. A perpetually active web of intangible streams of information communicated over our infrastructure, creating this sort of…”

“Webway.” Thacea offered.

“Yeah, something like that. Like a web composed of lines of communication, coalescing into this always-active hive of live data that anyone can access.” 

“What purpose would having a webway for the masses serve—”

“A tool for politics, I’m assuming.” Thacea interjected once more, swerving right into the lupinor prince’s winding and confusing train of thought. “If Emma’s world is what she claims it to be, then the only means by which the masses can rule themselves without a single or consolidated group of individuals becoming disproportionately powerful, is by a sort of… democratization of not just the legal mechanism of politics, but its dissemination within socio-cultural lines as well.” 

I blinked rapidly at that, my mouth hanging slightly agape at the princess’ rationalizations. 

“That’s a huge part of it, actually.” I nodded rapidly. “‘Free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny.’ High Commissioner Pravin Lal.” I promptly quoted. “Our modern democratic institutions were molded and reformed with transparency for the masses in mind. Discourses in all levels of the legislature are open to public scrutiny, and even those hidden for security concerns, have statutes on just how long they’re able to be hidden away. Scrutiny by the masses is made possible by our hyperconnected world, so much so that it’s often said that there are three auditing institutions a politician has to be wary of. The first being the Judicial Review Council, the second being the Office of the First Speaker, and the third being the High Court of Public Review — the prying eyes of a billion participants active in the infosphere at any given point in time.” 

Silence once more descended on the trio, with Thacea’s eyes closing down tightly, as if in deep thought following that.

Thalmin, meanwhile, had barely shifted in his expression, remaining in that sort of flabbergasted look of disbelief as if still processing it all.

It would be Ilunor, however, who eventually broke the silence with a simple, understandable rebuttal.

“Madness.” He scolded. “A system doomed for failure, either through collapse or indecision.” 

“There were times that happened, I admit.” I acknowledged. “The First Intrasolar War, to be precise, but that’s why reforms happened and… well, that’s a story for another day.” I laughed it off awkwardly before Thacea finally opened her eyes, staring at me with a sort of wariness I’d become accustomed to by now.

“These are solutions to a problem that didn’t need to exist, earthrealmer.” Ilunor surmised. “Such complications arise as a result of a resistance against what should be self-evident — the natural inclination for chaos without strong rulers. This is why royalty, nobility, and the aristocracy are needed. This is why even with your manaless dispositions, a tyrant masquerading as a monarch might simply be more reasonable than the unnatural state you force yourselves into. You waste so much in propping up something which should not exist, whilst we—”

“Can’t even provide a decent quality of life for your people.” I countered. “That’s the underlying difference between our two mindsets, Ilunor. We measure our success based on how best we can elevate the quality of lives of the masses; how well we treat the most vulnerable to the average joe. Meanwhile, you measure success exclusively by the exploits of nobles, tallying your achievements solely by their accumulation of power, both magical and otherwise.” 

We were just about ready to butt heads yet again, if not for Thacea promptly stepping in between us, placing both hands to separate our growing feud.

“Emma.” She began sternly. “Isn’t there more you wish for us to aid you with, in regards to your… artifice’s machinations?” 

“Oh, yeah, I was hoping to get some readings on some basic spells and magic. As well as like, a basic rundown of the types of mana just to calibrate the wand and—” 

[Notice: General equipment calibration in process… User interface prototype in queue… Warning: Additional data aggregation will result in a decrease of processing efficiency and reserve processing capacity. Suggestion: Delay additional testing until further notice.]

“... maybe that can wait.” I quickly added. “We’re burning daylight, and I think I wanna get some sparring done with Thalmin before we get back into the thick of things with the wand.” I offered, garnering a nod from the princess and a disgruntled shrug from Ilunor.

The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. En Route to the Hall of Champions. Local Time: 1535 Hours.  

Emma

I took the EVI’s pleas for leniency as an opportunity to finally take on Thalmin’s offer, as we both left for the Hall of Champions, leaving a visibly upset Ilunor to mope at the heels of an increasingly contemplative Thacea. 

While excited by both prospects, the thought of filling out additional paperwork in the form of annexes, addenda, and appendices when it came to the more technical projects sent shivers down my spine.

Though ironically, perhaps one of the largest sections to be filled in this week’s action report wasn’t about the WAID, but something that had yet to transpire — the GUN’s first true joint military exercise with a truly foreign polity. 

A paradigm ‘first’ in all but pomp and circumstance. 

A paradox was quickly forming. Wherein a lot was happening in my mind without much, if anything, truly precipitating into words, let alone actions.

Words and ideas passed me by as quickly as new thoughts came in to replace them, creating this constant buffering where I had too much to say, without anything being said at all. 

Excitement, anticipation, and giddiness all clouded my mind, as I struggled to really approach what was quickly coming to be.

The sheer number of implications that this simple sparring match carried with it would’ve required a hundred committees to parse… before inevitably collapsing, re-forming, and then collapsing again all in the span of months. 

And here I was, tackling it alone.

Yet at the same time, I couldn’t get past the understanding of what this truly was — a friendly matchup and nothing more.

This wasn’t something grand, epic, or truly reality-defining.

Instead, it felt like a natural evolution. Another step in the path towards forging stronger bonds between two comrades in arms.

It was probably this functional disconnect between what was technically happening, versus what was actually happening that was messing with me.

And at the end of the day… I was probably just overthinking things again.

But I couldn’t help it, especially given how the soldier in me often butted heads with the diplomat I was also meant to embody.

This stray thought eventually gave rise to an opening talking point that was very much needed.

“So… how do you do it, Thalmin? How do you handle being so many things at once?”

“I’m sorry?” The prince responded, cocking his head as he did so.

“As in, how do you handle your disparate responsibilities? From what we’ve discussed, you are as deep into the military pipeline as you are a royal. How the heck do you balance state administration, international diplomacy, and your martial responsibilities?” 

“Ah, so the pressures have finally gotten to you, haven’t they?” The lupinor chuckled, crossing his arms as he did so. 

“It probably should’ve gotten me ages ago, but I guess the constant stressors have either started to wear off… or… my brain chemistry has probably adapted to being swamped in adrenaline 24/7. Either way, the effect remains the same. I kinda want to know how you manage to deal with it.”

The prince chuckled cockily at that response, crossing his arms in a show of personal pride. “Breeding, heritage, lineage, and blood, Cadet Emma Booker.” Thalmin spoke uncharacteristically, sporting a smarmy grin that eventually broke out into an uproarious laugh. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t help myself.” He managed out in between breaths. “But tell me, how was my Ilunor impression?”

The flurry of emotions that quickly followed was both confusing and cathartic, leaving me with little option but to catch the lupinor’s contagious laugh, letting out a series of cackles in the process. 

“Pretty good, perhaps too good if you ask me.” I let out through a relieved sigh. “Honestly, if our deluxe kobold carried himself with just half your stoicism, then he’d probably be a lot more menacing than he is.” 

“Well, consider me flattered, Emma.” The prince acknowledged with a dip of his head. “But in all seriousness, I will say that it’s quite impressive how well you’ve held your own, especially for a commoner. To be quite frank, the way you carry yourself and the decisions you’ve consistently made have pushed me so far as to have completely forgotten that aspect of your identity.” He offered, before promptly adding with a sheepish smile. “And I mean that as a compliment. I hold nothing but respect for your achievements as an individual, not in spite of or because of your supposed status.”

“Right.” I acknowledged with a nod, prompting the lupinor to quickly shift his tone.

“But to address your question, Emma? I’ll need to preface this by saying that I’m quite possibly the least conventional royal to ask for advice. Havenbrock and its royal family is, after all… quite unconventional, if you haven’t already noticed.” 

“That does seem to be the general consensus, not that I agree it's warranted.” I replied diplomatically. 

“Indeed. How I personally manage the handling of so many disparate responsibilities is simple — exposure. Exposure and experience are the keys to tempering the panic and nervousness that come with encountering unforeseen circumstances. This is the fundamental principle that both my father and uncle have raised me by, and the one I credit for my continued survival.” He paused as we reached one of the many twists and turns between the dorms and the stadium. “The life of a Havenbrockian royal isn’t about glitz, glamor, or stately decorum. It is moreso centered around the literal fight for survival, which in turn makes almost everything else seem superficial by comparison.” 

Thalmin eventually capped that off with another snarky smile. “I told you this wouldn’t be the answer you were looking for.”

“No, no. That… honestly aligns pretty well with something my Aunt said a while back, honestly. Especially the whole perspective shift thing about having been in life-and-death situations, and seeing everything else after that point as being kinda… trivial, so to speak.” 

This prompted Thalmin to raise a brow, just as we were finally about to leave the towers. “I take it your aunt is also a warrior in some capacity?”

“Yeah, she was. For a pretty long while too.” I answered frankly.

“Might I ask what sort of role she served?” 

“She served in our version of…” I paused, trying my best to actually explain the whole mission statement of the Terrestrial and Space Expeditionary Corps to Thalmin. “...a form of elite rapid response strike, recon, and pathfinding group trained for any environment; from space, to any realms floating within it, to traditional surface operations.”

The lupinor paused, pondering this for a moment with wide eyes. “So… does your Aunt ride those firespears we witnessed earlier into combat?” 

“Well… sort of. Like I said before, the ancient firespears I showed you are a thousand years behind me, so she’s—”

“So I was right.” Thalmin whispered under his breath, fist bumping the air in the process.

“I’m… sorry?”

“You showed that those firespears could supposedly be used to deploy people to the void and other realms. Internally, I had theorized that they could likewise be repurposed for the deployment of soldiers to any point within a realm. A sort of void legion, or perhaps even a void diver of sorts.” 

I paused, blinking rapidly at the excitable lupinor who I could only smile nervously at. 

“I mean… you aren’t too far off in your assumptions, Thalmin. Our firespears, even in that era, were also weaponized.” I admitted. “I just didn’t have time to include that in our presentation since explaining the void was much more of a priority.” I trailed off, garnering a narrowing gaze from the lupinor.

“Understandable. However, I would like a glimpse at such weapons in the future, if that is at all possible.” 

“Yeah, sure, I’ll… put that on the list of presentations when we get to it.” I offered nervously, prompting an equally suspicious nod before the lupinor moved onto another topic entirely.

“Forgive me if this is intrusive to ask, but considering your aunt’s service, am I correct to assume that you belong to a lineage of warriors and soldiers?” The lupinor questioned, raising a hand to rub the bottom of his snout as he did so. 

“I mean, it’s somewhat of a tradition, one that members of my aunt’s side of the family tend to take on sporadically. But it isn’t enforced or anything if that’s what you’re asking.” 

“I see.” Thalmin nodded, a glint of some deep thought behind those eyes. “You will have to tell me more about your aunt in the future, Emma, as well as her exploits as this… void diver of sorts. Provided, of course, that she’s seen active service.” 

“Oh, she definitely has.” I chuckled cockily. “If anything, she’s quite literally the most well-decorated veteran in living memory. Considering she’s participated in practically every major engagement in a flashpoint conflict in one of our realms. The one and only conflict to have erupted in our otherwise three centuries of uninterrupted peace.” 

Thalmin raised an excited brow at that, a fangy grin forming soon after. “I can start to see why your people chose you to be their candidate, Emma.”

Emma

We arrived at the Hall to an audience of one. 

Meeting a certain felinor who, after much convincing, approved us for a private booking of one of the smaller halls to the side of the main stadium. 

However, her reluctance to approve us at first stemmed less from our intent to spar, but a more pertinent issue still fresh in her mind.

“And you are certain that you have fully healed, Cadet Emma—”

I addressed the professor’s concerns with a swift movement of my pinkie, bending it to within its natural limits, before reaching it out to her much to her surprise. “I pinkie promise it, professor.” 

The bewildered professor paused for a moment, before simply going with the flow and completing the foreign gesture with a protracted pinkie claw. 

“Is this the work of some miracle panacea, or a result of your natural regeneration abilities, Cadet Emma Booker?” She pointedly asked. 

“A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B I suppose.” I answered coyly, causing the felinor to simply let out a sigh before donning a polite smile, one which was barely able to hide the burning curiosity behind those slitted pupils. 

“Very well. I won’t take much more of your time Cadet Booker. Prince Havenbrock.” She turned to face Thalmin for a moment, dipping her head slightly in respect. “If you need me, I will be in the stadium’s offices.” 

With that, the professor quite literally leaped away, disappearing into the rafters to the tune of a mana radiation warning and the whirring of the calibrating WAID.

At which point, I was reminded to quickly address the elephant in the room, before it became too large of a talking point during the spar. 

“EVI?”

“Yes, Cadet Booker?”

“Training mode, on. Active Assists, off. Save for the bare minimum of actual threat mitigation emergency countermeasures, of course.”

“Acknowledged.” 

If this was to be a proper training session, then I needed the EVI’s active assists deactivated. Otherwise, there really wouldn’t be a point to this.

Thalmin wasted no time in speed-walking us to the smaller training stadium, opening those two sliding dark oak doors to reveal what was, by all measures, a cross between one of those traditional dojos and a high school basketball court. 

The vibes and general aesthetic definitely fit the former, what with the heavy use of wood for the floors, pillars, and rafters. However, the presence of bleachers, stands, and magical lighting equipment alongside the wrought iron scaffolding gave it an undeniably ‘modern’ aesthetic that was difficult to ignore.  

The space certainly was more appropriate for a one-on-one session, though, as the size wasn’t anywhere near as overwhelming as the big open stadium it was connected to.

“I’d be remiss if I did not address a fundamental disconnect between our two peoples, Emma.” Thalmin began as he strode his way up and through one the bleachers, navigating us through to the center of the gymnasium. “The proverbial wyvern in the nursery, so to speak.” He continued as he moved closer towards me before deploying a privacy screen. “A tool — nay, a weapon —  that grants commoners the ability to kill from a hundred paces.” The lupinor stopped, gesturing at the distance between us. “Bridging the martial gap, in a way that only mages and the gifted can. Without once making use of magic, neither inherent nor enchanted.” He finished his statement, raising his right hand and extending a single index finger whilst clenching the rest of his fist, as if in an attempt to mimic the shape of my pistol.

“The martial gap?” I parroted, unclasping my holster in the process. 

“Aye, that which separates commoners from nobles, a fundamental crux rendering their attempts at harm completely null and void — distance.” The prince elaborated, taking the time to walk circles around me with his hands clasped firmly behind his back. “Physical distance is what underpins the martial gap, a functional disadvantage spurred on by a noble’s inherent natural advantages.”

“Ranged attacks.” I offered bluntly.

“Precisely.” Thalmin acknowledged, before once more stretching out his arm. “A noble’s capabilities in war are only limited by their imagination. Whilst those in their service, be they chosen ones or men-at-arms, would be provided the training or enchanted weapons necessary for accomplishing much of the same, albeit to an admittedly lesser capacity.”

The prince paused, halting his walk as he did so. “Roads to power, both soft and hard, can be traced to magic and those that wield it. For those without, their fates are sealed — sidelined to irrelevance by virtue of their inefficacy.”

He let out a sigh, raising both arms out to his sides. “For even if a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand commoners were to march towards a castle’s walls… they would be burned, drowned, frozen, subsumed, or imploded before once setting their eyes on their intended adversary.” 

“And even those gifted with enchanted weapons all rely on mages not only for their production but also for their fuel, upkeep, and maintenance.” I reasoned, crossing my arms as I did so.

“Precisely. Which is what I wished to address next — that the martial gap applies to matters beyond the functional disparity of distance, but is also a term applied to the inherent gap that naturally arises as a result of this status quo.” 

I exhaled sharply at that. As despite Thalmin simply reinforcing what I’d already worked out, it just felt… jarring to hear it all laid out so blatantly, as a named principle at that.

“Your kind, despite lacking magic, have created a weapon capable of breaching that gap. Not just physically, but in every sense of the word.” Thalmin continued, his features stiffening if only for a moment, as it was clear something was currently spooling up behind those yellow eyes. 

“Now tell me, exactly what did your training entail?” He transitioned abruptly, as if trying to steer away from a subject matter that was bound to crop up eventually.

“Well… my training wasn’t exactly what you’d call typical.” I began frankly. “For starters, I was run through an unconventional combo of Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training tailored just for this mission, while also taking class hours for stuff typically reserved for Officer Candidate School. BCT typically takes six months, followed by anywhere from six months to a year for AIT, but—”

“I meant the actual contents of your training, Emma.” Thalmin interjected, letting out a frustrated sigh as he did so.

“Oh, right, sorry. Yeah, so, most of it was accelerated BCT. So stuff like physical training, small arms weapons instruction and drilling—”

“Small arms?” Thalmin quickly interrupted.

“As you might expect, we have a lot of weapons types that have spawned over the years.” I pulled out my gun for emphasis. “The sheer variety of weapons required an equally diverse classification system in order to categorize them as a result. With small arms eventually coming to encompass any individual-use firearm that does not require the use of partially powered or fully powered exoskeletons to function to their fullest capability.” 

Thalmin blinked rapidly, before once more narrowing his eyes in suspicion.

“You mentioned exoskeletons.” Thalmin inquired sharply. “A-are you implying your people are in some way… arachnous or insectoid—”

“Oh, nonono. By exoskeletons, I basically mean this—” I paused, gesturing at my armor for emphasis. “It’s a complex system of… well… machines, basically. Machines that clamp all around a user in order to bolster and boost their strength by the power of mechanical force!” I beamed. “As such, what I meant was that there are some weapons that work functionally as small arms, but are only ever usable for individuals wearing some form of exoskeleton-assist kits.”

Thalmin’s suspicions didn’t fully subside however, though he seemed to just run with it for the time being.

“And what happens if one uses one of these weapons without the aid of an… exoskeleton?”

“The recoil will dislocate or break your shoulder and/or wrist.” I replied bluntly, causing the prince to blink rapidly in response.

“As you can imagine, firing a traditional chem-kinetic weapon comes with the caveat of force being generated. So… the larger the explosion in the gun, the more kickback you’ll expect.” I shrugged. 

“I see.” Thalmin responded slowly. “I… assume the next category up from ‘small arms’ to be ‘large’ arms, and perhaps ‘medium’ arms too, yes?”

“Erm…” I paused yet again, reaching for the back of my neck in preparation for the explanation to come. “The next ‘step up’ as it were, is actually light weapons.” 

That answer prompted the lupinor to simply stare at me blankly, his mouth curling up in a fit of confusion. 

“But we started with small arms—”

“The next step up following light weapons is heavy weapons, if that helps any.” I smiled awkwardly.

“Of course it is.” The prince acknowledged with a drained breath, gripping the bridge of his snout in the process. “I apologize for leading our conversation astray. I was not anticipating, nor at all ready, for another semantics lesson. To no fault of your own, of course.” The prince let out a polite sigh, before gesturing towards me with a single hand. “Let us return to our original line of discussion.”

“So, yeah, small arms training. I had plenty of that, along with light and heavy weapons training in accordance with my Advanced Power Armored Specialist, or APAS certification.” I inhaled deeply, steadying myself for a rapid-fire delivery of mil-spec jargon. “Then there was advanced equipment training because of the power armor, along with advanced electronic operation’s training as a baseline requisite, tactics and strategy training, battlefield drone and recon training, expedited forward operations training, and of course, there was also Close Quarters Combat, or CQC training.” 

While the lupinor’s attentiveness waned with each piece of jargon, it was that latter category that prompted Thalmin to perk up and chime in.

“And this… close quarters combat, I assume it is a sort of martial art?”

“Various martial arts distilled into a condensed package.” I nodded. “It draws from many ancient and modern disciplines, but with a core focus on surviving unarmed.” I continued methodically. “The first lesson, if anything, is preventative — consisting of tactics on how not to lose your primary in the first place.” 

“Your primary being your gun, correct?”

“Yup!” I nodded.

“Proceed.” The wolf urged.

“In addition to that first lesson, you got lessons on controlling your assailant during an all-out brawl; open hand strikes, knee strikes, anything and everything to get them off of you. Really, you’re not gunning to win a mixed martial arts match here. You’re more or less just trying to disengage ‘safely’ to the point where backup arrives or where you’re able to regain control of a weapon.” 

The lupinor’s features morphed from one of stoic intent to one drowning in thoughtful contemplation, his eyes beckoning some internal turmoil rumbling away beneath the surface.

“This sounds less like a tutelage on dueling, and more like instructions for when you’re driven to the last resort.” He offered with disappointment.

“Precisely.” I nodded. “The idea is that if you’ve reached a point where you’re left unarmed and fighting, then something’s already gone terribly wrong.”

Thalmin acknowledged this with a series of slow nods, his hand gripping the bottom of his snout as he did so.

“And… melee weapons?”

“Oh, right, there’s this.” I acknowledged with a nod, and a quick draw of the Mark XIV multipurpose combat and utility knife. “Fourth generation composalite with a leading monomolecular diamond edge.” 

Thalmin stared at the blade with a quirk of his brow, looking not too impressed by, well… everything about it.

However, that expression soon shifted to one of contemplative realization, returning to the very face he’d led this conversation with in the first place.

“So you really have abandoned the notion of melee weapons as a primary offensive tool.” He whispered under his breath, the implications of which prompted him to lock his gaze onto my pistol with increasing intensity. 

“Yeah. No offense to you and your arts, of course, but swords and melee weapons have been obsolete in our realm for the better part of a millennium.” I acknowledged frankly. “It’s just… no longer an effective killing tool. At least, not when stacked up against the sorts of weapons I’ve shown you.” I quickly added. “And in conflicts, that’s kinda what counts, right?” 

“Along with the capacity to maintain said weapons of war. Capability is meaningless without sustainability or scale.” Thalmin reasoned. “Though… if what you stated weeks ago was anything to go by…” He trailed off, allowing me to address that particular point. 

“Sustainability, logistics, and scale are the hallmarks of what makes modern warfare, well… modern.” I answered plainly. “So everything I said in that conversation wasn’t posturing, but an abject fact.” I shivered just referencing that conversation, especially given its preceding context — the null fight — was still as fresh in my mind as the day I’d faced it down. “There’s enough guns in my realm to arm every human currently living a hundred times over, and that’s not to mention the ammunition…”

“But surely that’s accumulative—”

“It is! But it wouldn’t really take too much to churn them out either. We have the industrial capacity to probably flood the entire surface of a realm in guns if we wanted to.” I paused, before letting out an awkward chuckle, once more reaching the back of my head awkwardly in order to defuse the situation. “That’s… not a hyperbole. Practically speaking, we could do it. But just because we could doesn’t mean we will.”

Thalmin’s face reflected the same ghostly visage he’d shown on that day, as his features quickly darkened along with his tone of voice. “But you could.”

“Yeah, we could. But like I said, we probably won’t have a need to.” I attempted to calm the situation down some. “I mean, unless the Nexus really gives us a reason to… but I doubt that’ll ever happen.” I offered sarcastically. 

To which Thalmin could only reply with a weary smile.

“So to confirm what you said previously, every soldier in your realm, every man-at-arms and void legionnaire, every sailor and flyer, all of them—”

“Go through some form of BCT, in which all of them are trained in the art of the gun, yeah.” I intercepted the man with a grin. 

Though it was clear his expressions were far less receptive, and more so mortified at the implications that came with this confirmation of what I’d only alluded to before.

“So you really have crossed the martial gap, all without once casting a single spell.” He reasoned, before once more narrowing his eyes. “And if your Void Diver Aunt is of any indication, not only have you crossed the gap in weapons, but likewise in conveyances too.”

“Yeah… but that’s a whole other story, Thalmin.” I chuckled darkly. “Suffice it to say, engagement distances in modern warfare aren't measured in meters, but in kilometers and then some.” 

That comment seemed to cause the man to shudder even moreso. “Snipers engage enemies kilometers out at a time, same for frontline drone operators, and I’m not even going to get into remote—”

“I see, Emma.” Thalmin interjected warily. “I see.” He sighed. 

A moment of silence punctuated our little back and forth, before he finally elongated his blade, forming the longsword I’d seen only a few times before.

“So you have mastered the manaless art of breaching the martial gap, creating entirely novel forms of not just weaponry, but the arts and industries required to sustain and maintain it all.” 

“Yup, that’s right.” I nodded proudly.

“Then I must ask… with what you currently have at your disposal, do you feel as if your tactics and strategies will be viable in the long term?”

“Yup! In fact, every piece of equipment I have with me was chosen just for that specific task. It’s the whole reason why they chose this specific model of armor to use as the base for my mission, despite it not being the most advanced or up-to-date. This logic extends to my gun, the ZNK-19, and every piece of tech I have with me. So the production of caseless ammo? Completely viable if not a non-issue whatsoever.” 

“But that requires the use of your larger equipment, no? Your tent, your… manaless microfactoriums.”

“Indeed.” I nodded.

Ilunor had remained silent following our spur-of-the-moment sightseeing trip to Acela. 

In fact, all three didn’t have much to say at all until Thalmin finally broke the silence as we snapped back to reality. 

“Emma… although I have described your people as a nation of scholars, it was always meant as a tentative hyperbole. Because while I can understand that such an abundance of information might be necessary for a certain social class of commoners — scholars, scribes, civil servants, and the like — I cannot see how said abundance would be useful for your average commoner.” He posited only to be answered, not by me, but by Thacea.

“It aligns with what Emma had claimed from the onset.” She began. “That there exist no gods or kings, but only the masses. And with that comes the responsibility and the burden of collective rule, facilitated by collective intelligence, which necessitates an abundance of accessible knowledge.” She turned towards me, as if knowing I was ready to tag team off of that statement.

“We all share and chip in, in carrying the burdens that come with civilization. Or more accurately, the responsibilities of maintaining civilization. We all benefit from it too, of course, and much of what you saw was either blatant benefits, or just utilitarian tools in making daily life a little bit easier.” 

Thalmin blinked at that, gesturing at the ZNK-19. “That was somehow an attempt to make life easier?!” 

“Well… it makes things more seamless. Especially as it pertains to stuff like travel, scheduling, and so on and so forth. Beyond that, there’s also the added benefit of having both the compendium of all human knowledge, current events, and the infosphere plus the extranet at your fingertips.” 

I’d lost the prince right about at the last sentence, the man resorting to staring blankly whilst Thacea’s eagle eyes narrowed even further until they were only pinpricks.

“Erm, I shouldn’t get into it right now, but suffice it to say our incorporeal world also comprises a sort of… communications network. A perpetually active web of intangible streams of information communicated over our infrastructure, creating this sort of…”

“Webway.” Thacea offered.

“Yeah, something like that. Like a web composed of lines of communication, coalescing into this always-active hive of live data that anyone can access.” 

“What purpose would having a webway for the masses serve—”

“A tool for politics, I’m assuming.” Thacea interjected once more, swerving right into the lupinor prince’s winding and confusing train of thought. “If Emma’s world is what she claims it to be, then the only means by which the masses can rule themselves without a single or consolidated group of individuals becoming disproportionately powerful, is by a sort of… democratization of not just the legal mechanism of politics, but its dissemination within socio-cultural lines as well.” 

I blinked rapidly at that, my mouth hanging slightly agape at the princess’ rationalizations. 

“That’s a huge part of it, actually.” I nodded rapidly. “‘Free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny.’ High Commissioner Pravin Lal.” I promptly quoted. “Our modern democratic institutions were molded and reformed with transparency for the masses in mind. Discourses in all levels of the legislature are open to public scrutiny, and even those hidden for security concerns, have statutes on just how long they’re able to be hidden away. Scrutiny by the masses is made possible by our hyperconnected world, so much so that it’s often said that there are three auditing institutions a politician has to be wary of. The first being the Judicial Review Council, the second being the Office of the First Speaker, and the third being the High Court of Public Review — the prying eyes of a billion participants active in the infosphere at any given point in time.” 

Silence once more descended on the trio, with Thacea’s eyes closing down tightly, as if in deep thought following that.

Thalmin, meanwhile, had barely shifted in his expression, remaining in that sort of flabbergasted look of disbelief as if still processing it all.

It would be Ilunor, however, who eventually broke the silence with a simple, understandable rebuttal.

“Madness.” He scolded. “A system doomed for failure, either through collapse or indecision.” 

“There were times that happened, I admit.” I acknowledged. “The First Intrasolar War, to be precise, but that’s why reforms happened and… well, that’s a story for another day.” I laughed it off awkwardly before Thacea finally opened her eyes, staring at me with a sort of wariness I’d become accustomed to by now.

“These are solutions to a problem that didn’t need to exist, earthrealmer.” Ilunor surmised. “Such complications arise as a result of a resistance against what should be self-evident — the natural inclination for chaos without strong rulers. This is why royalty, nobility, and the aristocracy are needed. This is why even with your manaless dispositions, a tyrant masquerading as a monarch might simply be more reasonable than the unnatural state you force yourselves into. You waste so much in propping up something which should not exist, whilst we—”

“Can’t even provide a decent quality of life for your people.” I countered. “That’s the underlying difference between our two mindsets, Ilunor. We measure our success based on how best we can elevate the quality of lives of the masses; how well we treat the most vulnerable to the average joe. Meanwhile, you measure success exclusively by the exploits of nobles, tallying your achievements solely by their accumulation of power, both magical and otherwise.” 

We were just about ready to butt heads yet again, if not for Thacea promptly stepping in between us, placing both hands to separate our growing feud.

“Emma.” She began sternly. “Isn’t there more you wish for us to aid you with, in regards to your… artifice’s machinations?” 

“Oh, yeah, I was hoping to get some readings on some basic spells and magic. As well as like, a basic rundown of the types of mana just to calibrate the wand and—” 

[Notice: General equipment calibration in process… User interface prototype in queue… Warning: Additional data aggregation will result in a decrease of processing efficiency and reserve processing capacity. Suggestion: Delay additional testing until further notice.]

“... maybe that can wait.” I quickly added. “We’re burning daylight, and I think I wanna get some sparring done with Thalmin before we get back into the thick of things with the wand.” I offered, garnering a nod from the princess and a disgruntled shrug from Ilunor.

The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. En Route to the Hall of Champions. Local Time: 1535 Hours.  

Emma

I took the EVI’s pleas for leniency as an opportunity to finally take on Thalmin’s offer, as we both left for the Hall of Champions, leaving a visibly upset Ilunor to mope at the heels of an increasingly contemplative Thacea. 

While excited by both prospects, the thought of filling out additional paperwork in the form of annexes, addenda, and appendices when it came to the more technical projects sent shivers down my spine.

Though ironically, perhaps one of the largest sections to be filled in this week’s action report wasn’t about the WAID, but something that had yet to transpire — the GUN’s first true joint military exercise with a truly foreign polity. 

A paradigm ‘first’ in all but pomp and circumstance. 

A paradox was quickly forming. Wherein a lot was happening in my mind without much, if anything, truly precipitating into words, let alone actions.

Words and ideas passed me by as quickly as new thoughts came in to replace them, creating this constant buffering where I had too much to say, without anything being said at all. 

Excitement, anticipation, and giddiness all clouded my mind, as I struggled to really approach what was quickly coming to be.

The sheer number of implications that this simple sparring match carried with it would’ve required a hundred committees to parse… before inevitably collapsing, re-forming, and then collapsing again all in the span of months. 

And here I was, tackling it alone.

Yet at the same time, I couldn’t get past the understanding of what this truly was — a friendly matchup and nothing more.

This wasn’t something grand, epic, or truly reality-defining.

Instead, it felt like a natural evolution. Another step in the path towards forging stronger bonds between two comrades in arms.

It was probably this functional disconnect between what was technically happening, versus what was actually happening that was messing with me.

And at the end of the day… I was probably just overthinking things again.

But I couldn’t help it, especially given how the soldier in me often butted heads with the diplomat I was also meant to embody.

This stray thought eventually gave rise to an opening talking point that was very much needed.

“So… how do you do it, Thalmin? How do you handle being so many things at once?”

“I’m sorry?” The prince responded, cocking his head as he did so.

“As in, how do you handle your disparate responsibilities? From what we’ve discussed, you are as deep into the military pipeline as you are a royal. How the heck do you balance state administration, international diplomacy, and your martial responsibilities?” 

“Ah, so the pressures have finally gotten to you, haven’t they?” The lupinor chuckled, crossing his arms as he did so. 

“It probably should’ve gotten me ages ago, but I guess the constant stressors have either started to wear off… or… my brain chemistry has probably adapted to being swamped in adrenaline 24/7. Either way, the effect remains the same. I kinda want to know how you manage to deal with it.”

The prince chuckled cockily at that response, crossing his arms in a show of personal pride. “Breeding, heritage, lineage, and blood, Cadet Emma Booker.” Thalmin spoke uncharacteristically, sporting a smarmy grin that eventually broke out into an uproarious laugh. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t help myself.” He managed out in between breaths. “But tell me, how was my Ilunor impression?”

The flurry of emotions that quickly followed was both confusing and cathartic, leaving me with little option but to catch the lupinor’s contagious laugh, letting out a series of cackles in the process. 

“Pretty good, perhaps too good if you ask me.” I let out through a relieved sigh. “Honestly, if our deluxe kobold carried himself with just half your stoicism, then he’d probably be a lot more menacing than he is.” 

“Well, consider me flattered, Emma.” The prince acknowledged with a dip of his head. “But in all seriousness, I will say that it’s quite impressive how well you’ve held your own, especially for a commoner. To be quite frank, the way you carry yourself and the decisions you’ve consistently made have pushed me so far as to have completely forgotten that aspect of your identity.” He offered, before promptly adding with a sheepish smile. “And I mean that as a compliment. I hold nothing but respect for your achievements as an individual, not in spite of or because of your supposed status.”

“Right.” I acknowledged with a nod, prompting the lupinor to quickly shift his tone.

“But to address your question, Emma? I’ll need to preface this by saying that I’m quite possibly the least conventional royal to ask for advice. Havenbrock and its royal family is, after all… quite unconventional, if you haven’t already noticed.” 

“That does seem to be the general consensus, not that I agree it's warranted.” I replied diplomatically. 

“Indeed. How I personally manage the handling of so many disparate responsibilities is simple — exposure. Exposure and experience are the keys to tempering the panic and nervousness that come with encountering unforeseen circumstances. This is the fundamental principle that both my father and uncle have raised me by, and the one I credit for my continued survival.” He paused as we reached one of the many twists and turns between the dorms and the stadium. “The life of a Havenbrockian royal isn’t about glitz, glamor, or stately decorum. It is moreso centered around the literal fight for survival, which in turn makes almost everything else seem superficial by comparison.” 

Thalmin eventually capped that off with another snarky smile. “I told you this wouldn’t be the answer you were looking for.”

“No, no. That… honestly aligns pretty well with something my Aunt said a while back, honestly. Especially the whole perspective shift thing about having been in life-and-death situations, and seeing everything else after that point as being kinda… trivial, so to speak.” 

This prompted Thalmin to raise a brow, just as we were finally about to leave the towers. “I take it your aunt is also a warrior in some capacity?”

“Yeah, she was. For a pretty long while too.” I answered frankly.

“Might I ask what sort of role she served?” 

“She served in our version of…” I paused, trying my best to actually explain the whole mission statement of the Terrestrial and Space Expeditionary Corps to Thalmin. “...a form of elite rapid response strike, recon, and pathfinding group trained for any environment; from space, to any realms floating within it, to traditional surface operations.”

The lupinor paused, pondering this for a moment with wide eyes. “So… does your Aunt ride those firespears we witnessed earlier into combat?” 

“Well… sort of. Like I said before, the ancient firespears I showed you are a thousand years behind me, so she’s—”

“So I was right.” Thalmin whispered under his breath, fist bumping the air in the process.

“I’m… sorry?”

“You showed that those firespears could supposedly be used to deploy people to the void and other realms. Internally, I had theorized that they could likewise be repurposed for the deployment of soldiers to any point within a realm. A sort of void legion, or perhaps even a void diver of sorts.” 

I paused, blinking rapidly at the excitable lupinor who I could only smile nervously at. 

“I mean… you aren’t too far off in your assumptions, Thalmin. Our firespears, even in that era, were also weaponized.” I admitted. “I just didn’t have time to include that in our presentation since explaining the void was much more of a priority.” I trailed off, garnering a narrowing gaze from the lupinor.

“Understandable. However, I would like a glimpse at such weapons in the future, if that is at all possible.” 

“Yeah, sure, I’ll… put that on the list of presentations when we get to it.” I offered nervously, prompting an equally suspicious nod before the lupinor moved onto another topic entirely.

“Forgive me if this is intrusive to ask, but considering your aunt’s service, am I correct to assume that you belong to a lineage of warriors and soldiers?” The lupinor questioned, raising a hand to rub the bottom of his snout as he did so. 

“I mean, it’s somewhat of a tradition, one that members of my aunt’s side of the family tend to take on sporadically. But it isn’t enforced or anything if that’s what you’re asking.” 

“I see.” Thalmin nodded, a glint of some deep thought behind those eyes. “You will have to tell me more about your aunt in the future, Emma, as well as her exploits as this… void diver of sorts. Provided, of course, that she’s seen active service.” 

“Oh, she definitely has.” I chuckled cockily. “If anything, she’s quite literally the most well-decorated veteran in living memory. Considering she’s participated in practically every major engagement in a flashpoint conflict in one of our realms. The one and only conflict to have erupted in our otherwise three centuries of uninterrupted peace.” 

Thalmin raised an excited brow at that, a fangy grin forming soon after. “I can start to see why your people chose you to be their candidate, Emma.”

The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. Hall of Champions. Liring’s Training Stadium. Local Time: 1557 Hours.  

Emma

We arrived at the Hall to an audience of one. 

Meeting a certain felinor who, after much convincing, approved us for a private booking of one of the smaller halls to the side of the main stadium. 

However, her reluctance to approve us at first stemmed less from our intent to spar, but a more pertinent issue still fresh in her mind.

“And you are certain that you have fully healed, Cadet Emma—”

I addressed the professor’s concerns with a swift movement of my pinkie, bending it to within its natural limits, before reaching it out to her much to her surprise. “I pinkie promise it, professor.” 

The bewildered professor paused for a moment, before simply going with the flow and completing the foreign gesture with a protracted pinkie claw. 

“Is this the work of some miracle panacea, or a result of your natural regeneration abilities, Cadet Emma Booker?” She pointedly asked. 

“A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B I suppose.” I answered coyly, causing the felinor to simply let out a sigh before donning a polite smile, one which was barely able to hide the burning curiosity behind those slitted pupils. 

“Very well. I won’t take much more of your time Cadet Booker. Prince Havenbrock.” She turned to face Thalmin for a moment, dipping her head slightly in respect. “If you need me, I will be in the stadium’s offices.” 

With that, the professor quite literally leaped away, disappearing into the rafters to the tune of a mana radiation warning and the whirring of the calibrating WAID.

At which point, I was reminded to quickly address the elephant in the room, before it became too large of a talking point during the spar. 

“EVI?”

“Yes, Cadet Booker?”

“Training mode, on. Active Assists, off. Save for the bare minimum of actual threat mitigation emergency countermeasures, of course.”

“Acknowledged.” 

If this was to be a proper training session, then I needed the EVI’s active assists deactivated. Otherwise, there really wouldn’t be a point to this.

Thalmin wasted no time in speed-walking us to the smaller training stadium, opening those two sliding dark oak doors to reveal what was, by all measures, a cross between one of those traditional dojos and a high school basketball court. 

The vibes and general aesthetic definitely fit the former, what with the heavy use of wood for the floors, pillars, and rafters. However, the presence of bleachers, stands, and magical lighting equipment alongside the wrought iron scaffolding gave it an undeniably ‘modern’ aesthetic that was difficult to ignore.  

The space certainly was more appropriate for a one-on-one session, though, as the size wasn’t anywhere near as overwhelming as the big open stadium it was connected to.

“I’d be remiss if I did not address a fundamental disconnect between our two peoples, Emma.” Thalmin began as he strode his way up and through one the bleachers, navigating us through to the center of the gymnasium. “The proverbial wyvern in the nursery, so to speak.” He continued as he moved closer towards me before deploying a privacy screen. “A tool — nay, a weapon —  that grants commoners the ability to kill from a hundred paces.” The lupinor stopped, gesturing at the distance between us. “Bridging the martial gap, in a way that only mages and the gifted can. Without once making use of magic, neither inherent nor enchanted.” He finished his statement, raising his right hand and extending a single index finger whilst clenching the rest of his fist, as if in an attempt to mimic the shape of my pistol.

“The martial gap?” I parroted, unclasping my holster in the process. 

“Aye, that which separates commoners from nobles, a fundamental crux rendering their attempts at harm completely null and void — distance.” The prince elaborated, taking the time to walk circles around me with his hands clasped firmly behind his back. “Physical distance is what underpins the martial gap, a functional disadvantage spurred on by a noble’s inherent natural advantages.”

“Ranged attacks.” I offered bluntly.

“Precisely.” Thalmin acknowledged, before once more stretching out his arm. “A noble’s capabilities in war are only limited by their imagination. Whilst those in their service, be they chosen ones or men-at-arms, would be provided the training or enchanted weapons necessary for accomplishing much of the same, albeit to an admittedly lesser capacity.”

The prince paused, halting his walk as he did so. “Roads to power, both soft and hard, can be traced to magic and those that wield it. For those without, their fates are sealed — sidelined to irrelevance by virtue of their inefficacy.”

He let out a sigh, raising both arms out to his sides. “For even if a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand commoners were to march towards a castle’s walls… they would be burned, drowned, frozen, subsumed, or imploded before once setting their eyes on their intended adversary.” 

“And even those gifted with enchanted weapons all rely on mages not only for their production but also for their fuel, upkeep, and maintenance.” I reasoned, crossing my arms as I did so.

“Precisely. Which is what I wished to address next — that the martial gap applies to matters beyond the functional disparity of distance, but is also a term applied to the inherent gap that naturally arises as a result of this status quo.” 

I exhaled sharply at that. As despite Thalmin simply reinforcing what I’d already worked out, it just felt… jarring to hear it all laid out so blatantly, as a named principle at that.

“Your kind, despite lacking magic, have created a weapon capable of breaching that gap. Not just physically, but in every sense of the word.” Thalmin continued, his features stiffening if only for a moment, as it was clear something was currently spooling up behind those yellow eyes. 

“Now tell me, exactly what did your training entail?” He transitioned abruptly, as if trying to steer away from a subject matter that was bound to crop up eventually.

“Well… my training wasn’t exactly what you’d call typical.” I began frankly. “For starters, I was run through an unconventional combo of Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training tailored just for this mission, while also taking class hours for stuff typically reserved for Officer Candidate School. BCT typically takes six months, followed by anywhere from six months to a year for AIT, but—”

“I meant the actual contents of your training, Emma.” Thalmin interjected, letting out a frustrated sigh as he did so.

“Oh, right, sorry. Yeah, so, most of it was accelerated BCT. So stuff like physical training, small arms weapons instruction and drilling—”

“Small arms?” Thalmin quickly interrupted.

“As you might expect, we have a lot of weapons types that have spawned over the years.” I pulled out my gun for emphasis. “The sheer variety of weapons required an equally diverse classification system in order to categorize them as a result. With small arms eventually coming to encompass any individual-use firearm that does not require the use of partially powered or fully powered exoskeletons to function to their fullest capability.” 

Thalmin blinked rapidly, before once more narrowing his eyes in suspicion.

“You mentioned exoskeletons.” Thalmin inquired sharply. “A-are you implying your people are in some way… arachnous or insectoid—”

“Oh, nonono. By exoskeletons, I basically mean this—” I paused, gesturing at my armor for emphasis. “It’s a complex system of… well… machines, basically. Machines that clamp all around a user in order to bolster and boost their strength by the power of mechanical force!” I beamed. “As such, what I meant was that there are some weapons that work functionally as small arms, but are only ever usable for individuals wearing some form of exoskeleton-assist kits.”

Thalmin’s suspicions didn’t fully subside however, though he seemed to just run with it for the time being.

“And what happens if one uses one of these weapons without the aid of an… exoskeleton?”

“The recoil will dislocate or break your shoulder and/or wrist.” I replied bluntly, causing the prince to blink rapidly in response.

“As you can imagine, firing a traditional chem-kinetic weapon comes with the caveat of force being generated. So… the larger the explosion in the gun, the more kickback you’ll expect.” I shrugged. 

“I see.” Thalmin responded slowly. “I… assume the next category up from ‘small arms’ to be ‘large’ arms, and perhaps ‘medium’ arms too, yes?”

“Erm…” I paused yet again, reaching for the back of my neck in preparation for the explanation to come. “The next ‘step up’ as it were, is actually light weapons.” 

That answer prompted the lupinor to simply stare at me blankly, his mouth curling up in a fit of confusion. 

“But we started with small arms—”

“The next step up following light weapons is heavy weapons, if that helps any.” I smiled awkwardly.

“Of course it is.” The prince acknowledged with a drained breath, gripping the bridge of his snout in the process. “I apologize for leading our conversation astray. I was not anticipating, nor at all ready, for another semantics lesson. To no fault of your own, of course.” The prince let out a polite sigh, before gesturing towards me with a single hand. “Let us return to our original line of discussion.”

“So, yeah, small arms training. I had plenty of that, along with light and heavy weapons training in accordance with my Advanced Power Armored Specialist, or APAS certification.” I inhaled deeply, steadying myself for a rapid-fire delivery of mil-spec jargon. “Then there was advanced equipment training because of the power armor, along with advanced electronic operation’s training as a baseline requisite, tactics and strategy training, battlefield drone and recon training, expedited forward operations training, and of course, there was also Close Quarters Combat, or CQC training.” 

While the lupinor’s attentiveness waned with each piece of jargon, it was that latter category that prompted Thalmin to perk up and chime in.

“And this… close quarters combat, I assume it is a sort of martial art?”

“Various martial arts distilled into a condensed package.” I nodded. “It draws from many ancient and modern disciplines, but with a core focus on surviving unarmed.” I continued methodically. “The first lesson, if anything, is preventative — consisting of tactics on how not to lose your primary in the first place.” 

“Your primary being your gun, correct?”

“Yup!” I nodded.

“Proceed.” The wolf urged.

“In addition to that first lesson, you got lessons on controlling your assailant during an all-out brawl; open hand strikes, knee strikes, anything and everything to get them off of you. Really, you’re not gunning to win a mixed martial arts match here. You’re more or less just trying to disengage ‘safely’ to the point where backup arrives or where you’re able to regain control of a weapon.” 

The lupinor’s features morphed from one of stoic intent to one drowning in thoughtful contemplation, his eyes beckoning some internal turmoil rumbling away beneath the surface.

“This sounds less like a tutelage on dueling, and more like instructions for when you’re driven to the last resort.” He offered with disappointment.

“Precisely.” I nodded. “The idea is that if you’ve reached a point where you’re left unarmed and fighting, then something’s already gone terribly wrong.”

Thalmin acknowledged this with a series of slow nods, his hand gripping the bottom of his snout as he did so.

“And… melee weapons?”

“Oh, right, there’s this.” I acknowledged with a nod, and a quick draw of the Mark XIV multipurpose combat and utility knife. “Fourth generation composalite with a leading monomolecular diamond edge.” 

Thalmin stared at the blade with a quirk of his brow, looking not too impressed by, well… everything about it.

However, that expression soon shifted to one of contemplative realization, returning to the very face he’d led this conversation with in the first place.

“So you really have abandoned the notion of melee weapons as a primary offensive tool.” He whispered under his breath, the implications of which prompted him to lock his gaze onto my pistol with increasing intensity. 

“Yeah. No offense to you and your arts, of course, but swords and melee weapons have been obsolete in our realm for the better part of a millennium.” I acknowledged frankly. “It’s just… no longer an effective killing tool. At least, not when stacked up against the sorts of weapons I’ve shown you.” I quickly added. “And in conflicts, that’s kinda what counts, right?” 

“Along with the capacity to maintain said weapons of war. Capability is meaningless without sustainability or scale.” Thalmin reasoned. “Though… if what you stated weeks ago was anything to go by…” He trailed off, allowing me to address that particular point. 

“Sustainability, logistics, and scale are the hallmarks of what makes modern warfare, well… modern.” I answered plainly. “So everything I said in that conversation wasn’t posturing, but an abject fact.” I shivered just referencing that conversation, especially given its preceding context — the null fight — was still as fresh in my mind as the day I’d faced it down. “There’s enough guns in my realm to arm every human currently living a hundred times over, and that’s not to mention the ammunition…”

“But surely that’s accumulative—”

“It is! But it wouldn’t really take too much to churn them out either. We have the industrial capacity to probably flood the entire surface of a realm in guns if we wanted to.” I paused, before letting out an awkward chuckle, once more reaching the back of my head awkwardly in order to defuse the situation. “That’s… not a hyperbole. Practically speaking, we could do it. But just because we could doesn’t mean we will.”

Thalmin’s face reflected the same ghostly visage he’d shown on that day, as his features quickly darkened along with his tone of voice. “But you could.”

“Yeah, we could. But like I said, we probably won’t have a need to.” I attempted to calm the situation down some. “I mean, unless the Nexus really gives us a reason to… but I doubt that’ll ever happen.” I offered sarcastically. 

To which Thalmin could only reply with a weary smile.

“So to confirm what you said previously, every soldier in your realm, every man-at-arms and void legionnaire, every sailor and flyer, all of them—”

“Go through some form of BCT, in which all of them are trained in the art of the gun, yeah.” I intercepted the man with a grin. 

Though it was clear his expressions were far less receptive, and more so mortified at the implications that came with this confirmation of what I’d only alluded to before.

“So you really have crossed the martial gap, all without once casting a single spell.” He reasoned, before once more narrowing his eyes. “And if your Void Diver Aunt is of any indication, not only have you crossed the gap in weapons, but likewise in conveyances too.”

“Yeah… but that’s a whole other story, Thalmin.” I chuckled darkly. “Suffice it to say, engagement distances in modern warfare aren't measured in meters, but in kilometers and then some.” 

That comment seemed to cause the man to shudder even moreso. “Snipers engage enemies kilometers out at a time, same for frontline drone operators, and I’m not even going to get into remote—”

“I see, Emma.” Thalmin interjected warily. “I see.” He sighed. 

A moment of silence punctuated our little back and forth, before he finally elongated his blade, forming the longsword I’d seen only a few times before.

“So you have mastered the manaless art of breaching the martial gap, creating entirely novel forms of not just weaponry, but the arts and industries required to sustain and maintain it all.” 

“Yup, that’s right.” I nodded proudly.

“Then I must ask… with what you currently have at your disposal, do you feel as if your tactics and strategies will be viable in the long term?”

“Yup! In fact, every piece of equipment I have with me was chosen just for that specific task. It’s the whole reason why they chose this specific model of armor to use as the base for my mission, despite it not being the most advanced or up-to-date. This logic extends to my gun, the ZNK-19, and every piece of tech I have with me. So the production of caseless ammo? Completely viable if not a non-issue whatsoever.” 

“But that requires the use of your larger equipment, no? Your tent, your… manaless microfactoriums.”

“Indeed.” I nodded.

“Our quest will take us away from these comforts of manaless logistics, Emma.

” “ you showed that those firespears could supposedly be used to deploy people to the void and other realms . internally , i had theorized that they could likewise be repurposed for the deployment of soldiers to any point within a realm . a sort of void legion , or perhaps even a void diver of sorts. ” i paused , blinking rapidly at the excitable lupinor who i could only at . “ i mean… you aren ’ t too far off in your assumptions , thalmin . our firespears , even in that era , were also weaponized. ” i admitted . “ i just didn ’ t have time to include that in our presentation since explaining the void was much more of a priority. ” i trailed off , garnering a narrowing gaze from the lupinor . “ . however , i would a glimpse at such weapons in the future , if that is at all possible. ” “ yeah , sure , i ’ ll… put that on the list of presentations when we get to it. ” i offered , prompting an equally nod before the lupinor moved onto another topic entirely . “ forgive me if this is to ask , but considering your aunt ’ s service , am i to assume that you belong to a lineage of warriors and soldiers ?

” thalmin quickly interrupted . “ as you might expect , we have a lot of weapons types that have spawned over the years. ” i pulled out my gun for emphasis . “ the sheer of weapons required an equally diverse classification system in order to categorize them as a result . with small arms eventually coming to encompass any individual-use firearm that does not require the use of partially powered or fully powered exoskeletons to function to their fullest capability. ” thalmin blinked rapidly , before once more narrowing his eyes in . “ you mentioned exoskeletons. ” thalmin inquired . “ a-are you implying your people are in some way… arachnous or insectoid— ” “ oh , nonono . by exoskeletons , i basically mean this— ” i paused , gesturing at my armor for emphasis . “ it ’ s a system of… well… machines , basically . machines that clamp all around a user in order to and their strength by the power of mechanical force ! ” i beamed . “ as such , what i meant was that there are some weapons that functionally as small arms , but are only ever for individuals wearing some form of exoskeleton-assist kits. ” thalmin ’ s didn ’ t fully subside however , though he seemed to just run with it for the time being . “ and what happens if one uses one of these weapons without the aid of an… exoskeleton ? ” “ the will dislocate or your shoulder and/or wrist. ” i replied bluntly , causing the prince to blink rapidly in response . “ as you can imagine , firing a traditional chem-kinetic weapon comes with the caveat of force being generated . so… the larger the explosion in the gun , the more kickback you ’ ll expect. ” i shrugged . “ i see. ” thalmin responded . “ i… assume the next category up from ‘ small arms ’ to be ‘ large ’ arms , and perhaps ‘ medium ’ arms too , yes ? ” “ erm… ” i paused yet again , reaching for the back of my neck in preparation for the explanation to come . “ the next ‘ step up ’ as it were , is actually light weapons. ” that answer prompted the lupinor to simply stare at me blankly , his mouth curling up in a fit of . “ but we started with small arms— ” “ the next step up following light weapons is heavy weapons , if that helps any. ” i smiled awkwardly . “ of course it is. ” the prince acknowledged with a breath , gripping the bridge of his snout in the process . “ i apologize for our conversation . i was not anticipating , nor at all , for another semantics lesson . to no of your own , of course. ” the prince let out a sigh , before gesturing towards me with a single hand . “ let us return to our original line of discussion. ” “ so , yeah , small arms training . i had plenty of that , along with light and heavy weapons training in accordance with my power armored specialist , or apas certification. ” i inhaled deeply , steadying myself for a rapid-fire delivery of mil-spec jargon . “ then there was equipment training because of the power armor , along with electronic operation ’ s training as a baseline requisite , tactics and strategy training , battlefield drone and recon training , expedited forward operations training , and of course , there was also close quarters combat , or cqc training. ” while the lupinor ’ s attentiveness waned with each piece of jargon , it was that latter category that prompted thalmin to perk up and chime in . “ and this… close quarters combat , i assume it is a sort of martial art ? ” “ various martial arts distilled into a condensed package. ” i nodded . “ it draws from many ancient and disciplines , but with a core focus on surviving unarmed. ” i continued methodically . “ the first lesson , if anything , is preventative — consisting of tactics on how not to your primary in the first place. ” “ your primary being your gun , ? ” “ yup ! ” i nodded . “ proceed. ” the wolf urged . “ in addition to that first lesson , you got lessons on controlling your assailant during an all-out brawl ; open hand strikes , knee strikes , anything and everything to get them off of you . really , you ’ re not gunning to a mixed martial arts match here . you ’ re more or less just trying to disengage ‘ ’ to the point where backup arrives or where you ’ re able to regain control of a weapon. ” the lupinor ’ s features morphed from one of stoic intent to one in contemplation , his eyes some internal away beneath the surface . “ this sounds less a tutelage on dueling , and more instructions for when you ’ re driven to the last resort. ” he offered with . “ precisely. ” i nodded . “ the idea is that if you ’ ve reached a point where you ’ re left unarmed and fighting , then something ’ s already gone wrong. ” thalmin acknowledged this with a series of nods , his hand gripping the bottom of his snout as he did so . “ and… melee weapons ? ” “ oh , , there ’ s this. ” i acknowledged with a nod , and a quick draw of the mark xiv multipurpose combat and utility . “ fourth generation composalite with a monomolecular diamond edge. ” thalmin stared at the blade with a quirk of his brow , looking not too by , well… everything about it . however , that expression soon shifted to one of contemplative realization , returning to the very face he ’ d this conversation with in the first place . “ so you really have abandoned the notion of melee weapons as a primary tool. ” he whispered under his breath , the implications of which prompted him to lock his gaze onto my pistol with increasing intensity . “ yeah . no offense to you and your arts , of course , but swords and melee weapons have been in our realm for the part of a millennium. ” i acknowledged frankly . “ it ’ s just… no longer an tool . at least , not when stacked up against the sorts of weapons i ’ ve shown you. ” i quickly added . “ and in , that ’ s kinda what counts , ? ” “ along with the capacity to maintain said weapons of war . is without or scale. ” thalmin . “ though… if what you stated weeks ago was anything to go by… ” he trailed off , allowing me to address that particular point . “ , logistics , and scale are the of what makes warfare , well… modern. ” i answered plainly . “ so everything i said in that conversation wasn ’ t , but an abject fact. ” i shivered just referencing that conversation , especially given its preceding context — the null fight — was still as in my mind as the day i ’ d faced it down . “ there ’ s guns in my realm to arm every human currently living a hundred times over , and that ’ s not to mention the ammunition… ” “ but surely that ’ s accumulative— ” “ it is ! but it wouldn ’ t really take too much to churn them out either . we have the industrial capacity to probably flood the entire surface of a realm in guns if we wanted to. ” i paused , before letting out an chuckle , once more reaching the back of my head awkwardly in order to defuse the situation . “ that ’ s… not a hyperbole . practically speaking , we could do it . but just because we could doesn ’ t mean we will. ” thalmin ’ s face reflected the same ghostly visage he ’ d shown on that day , as his features quickly along with his tone of voice . “ but you could. ” “ yeah , we could . but i said , we probably ’ t have a need to. ” i attempted to the situation down some . “ i mean , unless the nexus really gives us a reason to… but i that ’ ll ever happen. ” i offered . to which thalmin could only reply with a . “ so to confirm what you said previously , every soldier in your realm , every man-at-arms and void legionnaire , every sailor and flyer , all of them— ” “ go through some form of bct , in which all of them are trained in the art of the gun , yeah. ” i intercepted the man with a . though it was his expressions were far less , and more so at the implications that came with this confirmation of what i ’ d only alluded to before . “ so you really have crossed the martial gap , all without once casting a single spell. ” he , before once more narrowing his eyes . “ and if your void diver aunt is of any indication , not only have you crossed the gap in weapons , but likewise in conveyances too. ” “ yeah… but that ’ s a whole other story , thalmin. ” i chuckled darkly . “ it to say , engagement distances in warfare are n't measured in meters , but in kilometers and then some. ” that comment seemed to cause the man to shudder even moreso . “ snipers engage kilometers out at a time , same for frontline drone operators , and i ’ m not even going to get into remote— ” “ i see , emma. ” thalmin interjected . “ i see. ” he sighed . a moment of silence punctuated our little back and forth , before he finally elongated his blade , forming the longsword i ’ d seen only a few times before . “ so you have mastered the manaless art of breaching the martial gap , creating entirely novel forms of not just weaponry , but the arts and industries required to sustain and maintain it all. ” “ yup , that ’ s right. ” i nodded proudly . “ then i must ask… with what you currently have at your disposal , do you feel as if your tactics and strategies will be viable in the long term ? ” “ yup ! in fact , every piece of equipment i have with me was chosen just for that specific task . it ’ s the whole reason why they chose this specific model of armor to use as the base for my mission , despite it not being the most or up-to-date . this logic extends to my gun , the znk-19 , and every piece of tech i have with me . so the production of caseless ammo ?

Ilunor had remained silent following our spur-of-the-moment sightseeing trip to Acela. 

In fact, all three didn’t have much to say at all until  finally broke the silence as we snapped back to reality. 

“Emma… although I have described your people as a nation of scholars, it was always meant as a tentative hyperbole. Because while I can understand that such an abundance of information might be necessary for a certain social class of commoners — scholars, scribes, civil servants, and the like — I cannot see how said abundance would be useful for your average commoner.” He posited only to be answered, not by me, but by Thacea.

“It aligns with what Emma had claimed from the onset.” She began. “That there exist no gods or kings, but only the masses. And with that comes the responsibility and the burden of collective rule, facilitated by collective intelligence, which necessitates an abundance of accessible knowledge.” She turned towards me, as if knowing I was ready to tag team off of that statement.

“We all share and chip in, in carrying the burdens that come with civilization. Or more accurately, the responsibilities of maintaining civilization. We all benefit from it too, of course, and much of what you  was either blatant benefits, or just utilitarian tools in making daily life a little bit easier.” 

 blinked at that, gesturing at the ZNK-19. “That was somehow an attempt to make life easier?!” 

“Well… it makes things more seamless. Especially as it pertains to stuff like travel, scheduling, and so on and so forth. Beyond that, there’s also the added benefit of having both the compendium of all human knowledge, current events, and the infosphere plus the extranet at your fingertips.” 

I’d lost the prince right about at the last sentence, the man resorting to staring blankly whilst Thacea’s eagle eyes narrowed even further until they were only pinpricks.

“Erm, I shouldn’t get into it right now, but suffice it to say our incorporeal world also comprises a sort of… communications network. A perpetually active web of intangible streams of information communicated over our infrastructure, creating this sort of…”

“Webway.” Thacea offered.

“Yeah, something like that. Like a web composed of lines of communication, coalescing into this always-active hive of live data that anyone can access.” 

“What purpose would having a webway for the masses serve—”

“A tool for politics, I’m assuming.” Thacea interjected once more, swerving right into the lupinor prince’s winding and confusing train of thought. “If Emma’s world is what she claims it to be, then the only means by which the masses can rule themselves without a single or consolidated group of individuals becoming disproportionately powerful, is by a sort of… democratization of not just the legal mechanism of politics, but its dissemination within socio-cultural lines as well.” 

I blinked rapidly at that, my mouth hanging slightly agape at the princess’ rationalizations. 

“That’s a huge part of it, actually.” I nodded rapidly. “‘ flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny.’ High Commissioner Pravin Lal.” I promptly quoted. “Our modern democratic institutions were molded and reformed with transparency for the masses in mind. Discourses in all levels of the legislature are open to public scrutiny, and even those hidden for security concerns, have statutes on just how long they’re able to be hidden away. Scrutiny by the masses is made possible by our hyperconnected world, so much so that it’s often said that there are three auditing institutions a politician has to be wary of. The first being the Judicial Review Council, the second being the Office of the First Speaker, and the third being the High Court of Public Review — the prying eyes of a billion participants active in the infosphere at any given point in time.” 

Silence once more descended on the trio, with Thacea’s eyes closing down tightly, as if in deep thought following that.

, meanwhile, had barely shifted in his expression, remaining in that sort of flabbergasted look of disbelief as if still processing it all.

It would be Ilunor, however, who eventually broke the silence with a simple, understandable rebuttal.

“Madness.” He scolded. “A system doomed for failure, either through collapse or indecision.” 

“There were times that happened, I admit.” I acknowledged. “The First Intrasolar War, to be precise, but that’s why reforms happened and… well, that’s a story for another day.” I laughed it off awkwardly before Thacea finally opened her eyes, staring at me with a sort of wariness I’d become accustomed to by now.

“These are solutions to a problem that didn’t need to exist, earthrealmer.” Ilunor surmised. “Such complications arise as a result of a resistance against what should be self-evident — the natural inclination for chaos without strong rulers. This is why royalty, nobility, and the aristocracy are needed. This is why even with your manaless dispositions, a tyrant masquerading as a monarch might simply be more reasonable than the unnatural state you force yourselves into. You waste so much in propping up something which should not exist, whilst we—”

“Can’t even provide a decent quality of life for your people.” I countered. “That’s the underlying difference between our two mindsets, Ilunor. We  our success based on how best we can elevate the quality of lives of the masses; how well we treat the most vulnerable to the average joe. Meanwhile, you  success exclusively by the exploits of nobles, tallying your achievements solely by their accumulation of power, both magical and otherwise.” 

We were just about ready to butt heads yet again, if not for Thacea promptly stepping in between us, placing both hands to separate our growing feud.

“Emma.” She began sternly. “Isn’t there more you wish for us to aid you with, in regards to your… artifice’s machinations?” 

“Oh, yeah, I was hoping to get some readings on some basic spells and magic. As well as like, a basic rundown of the types of mana just to calibrate the wand and—” 

[Notice: General equipment calibration in process… User interface prototype in queue… Warning: Additional data aggregation will result in a decrease of processing efficiency and reserve processing capacity. Suggestion: Delay additional testing until further notice.]

“... maybe that can wait.” I quickly added. “We’re burning daylight, and I think I wanna get some sparring done with  before we get back into the thick of things with the wand.” I offered, garnering a nod from the princess and a disgruntled shrug from Ilunor.

The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. En Route to the Hall of Champions. Local Time: 1535 Hours.  

Emma

I took the EVI’s pleas for leniency as an opportunity to finally take on ’s offer, as we both left for the Hall of Champions, leaving a visibly upset Ilunor to mope at the heels of an increasingly contemplative Thacea. 

While excited by both prospects, the thought of filling out additional paperwork in the form of annexes, addenda, and appendices when it came to the more technical projects sent shivers down my spine.

Though ironically, perhaps one of the largest sections to be filled in this week’s action report wasn’t about the WAID, but something that had yet to transpire — the GUN’s first true joint military exercise with a truly foreign polity. 

A paradigm ‘first’ in all but pomp and circumstance. 

A paradox was quickly forming. Wherein a lot was happening in my mind without much, if anything, truly precipitating into words, let alone actions.

Words and ideas passed me by as quickly as new thoughts came in to replace them, creating this constant buffering where I had too much to say, without anything being said at all. 

Excitement, anticipation, and giddiness all clouded my mind, as I struggled to really approach what was quickly coming to be.

The sheer number of implications that this simple sparring match carried with it would’ve required a hundred committees to parse… before inevitably collapsing, re-forming, and then collapsing again all in the span of months. 

And here I was, tackling it alone.

Yet at the same time, I couldn’t get past the understanding of what this truly was — a friendly matchup and nothing more.

This wasn’t something grand, epic, or truly reality-defining.

Instead, it felt like a natural evolution. Another step in the path towards forging stronger bonds between two comrades in arms.

It was probably this functional disconnect between what was technically happening, versus what was actually happening that was messing with me.

And at the end of the day… I was probably just overthinking things again.

But I couldn’t help it, especially given how the soldier in me often butted heads with the diplomat I was also meant to embody.

This stray thought eventually gave rise to an opening talking point that was very much needed.

“So… how do you do it, ? How do you handle being so many things at once?”

“I’m sorry?” The prince responded, cocking his head as he did so.

“As in, how do you handle your disparate responsibilities? From what we’ve discussed, you are as deep into the military pipeline as you are a royal. How the heck do you balance state administration, international diplomacy, and your martial responsibilities?” 

“Ah, so the pressures have finally gotten to you, haven’t they?” The lupinor chuckled, crossing his arms as he did so. 

“It probably should’ve gotten me ages ago, but I guess the constant stressors have either started to wear off… or… my brain chemistry has probably adapted to being swamped in adrenaline 24/7. Either way, the effect remains the same. I kinda want to know how you manage to deal with it.”

The prince chuckled cockily at that response, crossing his arms in a show of personal . “Breeding, heritage, lineage, and blood, Cadet Emma Booker.”  spoke uncharacteristically, sporting a smarmy grin that eventually broke out into an uproarious laugh. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t help myself.” He managed out in between breaths. “But tell me, how was my Ilunor impression?”

The flurry of emotions that quickly followed was both confusing and cathartic, leaving me with little option but to catch the lupinor’s contagious laugh, letting out a series of cackles in the process. 

“Pretty good, perhaps too good if you ask me.” I let out through a relieved sigh. “Honestly, if our deluxe kobold carried himself with just half your stoicism, then he’d probably be a lot more menacing than he is.” 

“Well, consider me flattered, Emma.” The prince acknowledged with a dip of his head. “But in all seriousness, I will say that it’s quite impressive how well you’ve held your own, especially for a commoner. To be quite frank, the way you carry yourself and the decisions you’ve consistently made have pushed me so far as to have completely forgotten that aspect of your identity.” He offered, before promptly adding with a sheepish smile. “And I mean that as a compliment. I hold nothing but respect for your achievements as an individual, not in spite of or because of your supposed status.”

“Right.” I acknowledged with a nod, prompting the lupinor to quickly shift his tone.

“But to address your question, Emma? I’ll need to preface this by saying that I’m quite possibly the least conventional royal to ask for advice. Havenbrock and its royal family is, after all… quite unconventional, if you haven’t already noticed.” 

“That does seem to be the general consensus, not that I agree it's warranted.” I replied diplomatically. 

“Indeed. How I personally manage the handling of so many disparate responsibilities is simple — exposure. Exposure and experience are the keys to tempering the panic and nervousness that come with encountering unforeseen circumstances. This is the fundamental principle that both my father and uncle have raised me by, and the one I credit for my continued survival.” He paused as we reached one of the many twists and turns between the dorms and the stadium. “The life of a Havenbrockian royal isn’t about glitz, glamor, or stately decorum. It is moreso centered around the literal fight for survival, which in turn makes almost everything else seem superficial by comparison.” 

 eventually capped that off with another snarky smile. “I told you this wouldn’t be the answer you were looking for.”

“No, no. That… honestly aligns pretty well with something my Aunt said a while back, honestly. Especially the whole perspective shift thing about having been in life-and-death situations, and seeing everything else after that point as being kinda… trivial, so to speak.” 

This prompted  to raise a brow, just as we were finally about to leave the towers. “I take it your aunt is also a warrior in some capacity?”

“Yeah, she was. For a pretty long while too.” I answered frankly.

“Might I ask what sort of role she served?” 

“She served in our version of…” I paused, trying my best to actually explain the whole mission statement of the Terrestrial and Space Expeditionary Corps to . “...a form of elite rapid response strike, recon, and pathfinding group trained for any environment; from space, to any realms floating within it, to traditional surface operations.”

The lupinor paused, pondering this for a moment with wide eyes. “So… does your Aunt ride those firespears we witnessed earlier into combat?” 

“Well… sort of. Like I said before, the ancient firespears I showed you are a thousand years behind me, so she’s—”

“So I was right.”  whispered under his breath, fist bumping the air in the process.

“I’m… sorry?”

“You showed that those firespears could supposedly be used to deploy people to the void and other realms. Internally, I had theorized that they could likewise be repurposed for the deployment of soldiers to any point within a realm. A sort of void legion, or perhaps even a void diver of sorts.” 

I paused, blinking rapidly at the excitable lupinor who I could only smile nervously at. 

“I mean… you aren’t too far off in your assumptions, . Our firespears, even in that era, were also weaponized.” I admitted. “I just didn’t have time to include that in our presentation since explaining the void was much more of a priority.” I trailed off, garnering a narrowing gaze from the lupinor.

“Understandable. However, I would like a glimpse at such weapons in the future, if that is at all possible.” 

“Yeah, sure, I’ll… put that on the list of presentations when we get to it.” I offered nervously, prompting an equally suspicious nod before the lupinor moved onto another topic entirely.

“Forgive me if this is intrusive to ask, but considering your aunt’s service, am I correct to assume that you belong to a lineage of warriors and soldiers?” The lupinor questioned, raising a hand to rub the bottom of his snout as he did so. 

“I mean, it’s somewhat of a tradition, one that members of my aunt’s side of the family tend to take on sporadically. But it isn’t enforced or anything if that’s what you’re asking.” 

“I see.”  nodded, a glint of some deep thought behind those eyes. “You will have to tell me more about your aunt in the future, Emma, as well as her exploits as this… void diver of sorts. Provided, of course, that she’s seen active service.” 

“Oh, she definitely has.” I chuckled cockily. “If anything, she’s quite literally the most well-decorated veteran in living memory. Considering she’s participated in practically every major engagement in a flashpoint conflict in one of our realms. The one and only conflict to have erupted in our otherwise three centuries of uninterrupted peace.” 

 raised an excited brow at that, a fangy grin forming soon after. “I can start to see why your people chose you to be their candidate, Emma.”

The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. Hall of Champions. Liring’s Training Stadium. Local Time: 1557 Hours.  

Emma

We arrived at the Hall to an audience of one. 

Meeting a certain felinor who, after much convincing, approved us for a private booking of one of the smaller halls to the side of the main stadium. 

However, her reluctance to approve us at first stemmed less from our intent to spar, but a more pertinent issue still fresh in her mind.

“And you are certain that you have fully healed, Cadet Emma—”

I addressed the professor’s concerns with a swift movement of my pinkie, bending it to within its natural limits, before reaching it out to her much to her surprise. “I pinkie promise it, professor.” 

The bewildered professor paused for a moment, before simply going with the flow and completing the foreign gesture with a protracted pinkie claw. 

“Is this the work of some miracle panacea, or a result of your natural regeneration abilities, Cadet Emma Booker?” She pointedly asked. 

“A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B I suppose.” I answered coyly, causing the felinor to simply let out a sigh before donning a polite smile, one which was barely able to hide the burning curiosity behind those slitted pupils. 

“Very well. I won’t take much more of your time Cadet Booker. Prince Havenbrock.” She turned to face  for a moment, dipping her head slightly in respect. “If you need me, I will be in the stadium’s offices.” 

With that, the professor quite literally leaped away, disappearing into the rafters to the tune of a mana radiation warning and the whirring of the calibrating WAID.

At which point, I was reminded to quickly address the elephant in the room, before it became too large of a talking point during the spar. 

“EVI?”

“Yes, Cadet Booker?”

“Training mode, on. Active Assists, off. Save for the bare minimum of actual threat mitigation emergency countermeasures, of course.”

“Acknowledged.” 

If this was to be a proper training session, then I needed the EVI’s active assists deactivated. Otherwise, there really wouldn’t be a point to this.

 wasted no time in speed-walking us to the smaller training stadium, opening those two sliding dark oak doors to reveal what was, by all measures, a cross between one of those traditional dojos and a high school basketball court. 

The vibes and general aesthetic definitely fit the former, what with the heavy use of wood for the floors, pillars, and rafters. However, the presence of bleachers, stands, and magical lighting equipment alongside the wrought iron scaffolding gave it an undeniably ‘modern’ aesthetic that was difficult to ignore.  

The space certainly was more appropriate for a one-on-one session, though, as the size wasn’t anywhere near as overwhelming as the big open stadium it was connected to.

“I’d be remiss if I did not address a fundamental disconnect between our two peoples, Emma.”  began as he strode his way up and through one the bleachers, navigating us through to the center of the gymnasium. “The proverbial wyvern in the nursery, so to speak.” He continued as he moved closer towards me before deploying a privacy screen. “A tool — nay, a weapon —  that grants commoners the ability to kill from a hundred paces.” The lupinor stopped, gesturing at the distance between us. “Bridging the martial gap, in a way that only mages and the gifted can. Without once making use of magic, neither inherent nor enchanted.” He finished his statement, raising his right hand and extending a single index finger whilst clenching the rest of his fist, as if in an attempt to mimic the shape of my pistol.

“The martial gap?” I parroted, unclasping my holster in the process. 

“Aye, that which separates commoners from nobles, a fundamental crux rendering their attempts at harm completely null and void — distance.” The prince elaborated, taking the time to walk circles around me with his hands clasped firmly behind his back. “Physical distance is what underpins the martial gap, a functional disadvantage spurred on by a noble’s inherent natural advantages.”

“Ranged attacks.” I offered bluntly.

“Precisely.”  acknowledged, before once more stretching out his arm. “A noble’s capabilities in war are only limited by their imagination. Whilst those in their service, be they chosen ones or men-at-arms, would be provided the training or enchanted weapons necessary for accomplishing much of the same, albeit to an admittedly lesser capacity.”

The prince paused, halting his walk as he did so. “Roads to power, both soft and hard, can be traced to magic and those that wield it. For those without, their fates are sealed — sidelined to irrelevance by virtue of their inefficacy.”

He let out a sigh, raising both arms out to his sides. “For even if a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand commoners were to march towards a castle’s walls… they would be burned, drowned, frozen, subsumed, or imploded before once setting their eyes on their intended adversary.” 

“And even those gifted with enchanted weapons all rely on mages not only for their production but also for their fuel, upkeep, and maintenance.” I reasoned, crossing my arms as I did so.

“Precisely. Which is what I wished to address next — that the martial gap applies to matters beyond the functional disparity of distance, but is also a term applied to the inherent gap that naturally arises as a result of this status quo.” 

I exhaled sharply at that. As despite  simply reinforcing what I’d already worked out, it just felt… jarring to hear it all laid out so blatantly, as a named principle at that.

“Your kind, despite lacking magic, have created a weapon capable of breaching that gap. Not just physically, but in every sense of the word.”  continued, his features stiffening if only for a moment, as it was clear something was currently spooling up behind those yellow eyes. 

“Now tell me, exactly what did your training entail?” He transitioned abruptly, as if trying to steer away from a subject matter that was bound to crop up eventually.

“Well… my training wasn’t exactly what you’d call typical.” I began frankly. “For starters, I was run through an unconventional combo of Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training tailored just for this mission, while also taking class hours for stuff typically reserved for Officer Candidate School. BCT typically takes six months, followed by anywhere from six months to a year for AIT, but—”

“I meant the actual contents of your training, Emma.”  interjected, letting out a frustrated sigh as he did so.

“Oh, right, sorry. Yeah, so, most of it was accelerated BCT. So stuff like physical training, small arms weapons instruction and drilling—”

“Small arms?”  quickly interrupted.

“As you might expect, we have a lot of weapons types that have spawned over the years.” I pulled out my gun for emphasis. “The sheer variety of weapons required an equally diverse classification system in order to categorize them as a result. With small arms eventually coming to encompass any individual-use firearm that does not require the use of partially powered or fully powered exoskeletons to function to their fullest capability.” 

 blinked rapidly, before once more narrowing his eyes in suspicion.

“You mentioned exoskeletons.”  inquired sharply. “A-are you implying your people are in some way… arachnous or insectoid—”

“Oh, nonono. By exoskeletons, I basically mean this—” I paused, gesturing at my armor for emphasis. “It’s a complex system of… well… machines, basically. Machines that clamp all around a user in order to bolster and boost their strength by the power of mechanical force!” I beamed. “As such, what I meant was that there are some weapons that work functionally as small arms, but are only ever usable for individuals wearing some form of exoskeleton-assist kits.”

’s suspicions didn’t fully subside however, though he seemed to just run with it for the time being.

“And what happens if one uses one of these weapons without the aid of an… exoskeleton?”

“The recoil will dislocate or break your shoulder and/or wrist.” I replied bluntly, causing the prince to blink rapidly in response.

“As you can imagine, firing a traditional chem-kinetic weapon comes with the caveat of force being generated. So… the larger the explosion in the gun, the more kickback you’ll expect.” I shrugged. 

“I see.”  responded slowly. “I… assume the next category up from ‘small arms’ to be ‘large’ arms, and perhaps ‘medium’ arms too, yes?”

“Erm…” I paused yet again, reaching for the back of my neck in preparation for the explanation to come. “The next ‘step up’ as it were, is actually light weapons.” 

That answer prompted the lupinor to simply stare at me blankly, his mouth curling up in a fit of confusion. 

“But we started with small arms—”

“The next step up following light weapons is heavy weapons, if that helps any.” I smiled awkwardly.

“Of course it is.” The prince acknowledged with a drained breath, gripping the bridge of his snout in the process. “I apologize for leading our conversation astray. I was not anticipating, nor at all ready, for another semantics lesson. To no fault of your own, of course.” The prince let out a polite sigh, before gesturing towards me with a single hand. “Let us return to our original line of discussion.”

“So, yeah, small arms training. I had plenty of that, along with light and heavy weapons training in accordance with my Advanced Power Armored Specialist, or APAS certification.” I inhaled deeply, steadying myself for a rapid-fire delivery of mil-spec jargon. “Then there was advanced equipment training because of the power armor, along with advanced electronic operation’s training as a baseline requisite, tactics and strategy training, battlefield drone and recon training, expedited forward operations training, and of course, there was also Close Quarters Combat, or CQC training.” 

While the lupinor’s attentiveness waned with each piece of jargon, it was that latter category that prompted  to perk up and chime in.

“And this… close quarters combat, I assume it is a sort of martial art?”

“Various martial arts distilled into a condensed package.” I nodded. “It draws from many ancient and modern disciplines, but with a core focus on surviving unarmed.” I continued methodically. “The first lesson, if anything, is preventative — consisting of tactics on how not to lose your primary in the first place.” 

“Your primary being your gun, correct?”

“Yup!” I nodded.

“Proceed.” The wolf urged.

“In addition to that first lesson, you got lessons on controlling your assailant during an all-out brawl; open hand strikes, knee strikes, anything and everything to get them off of you. Really, you’re not gunning to win a mixed martial arts match here. You’re more or less just trying to disengage ‘safely’ to the point where backup arrives or where you’re able to regain control of a weapon.” 

The lupinor’s features morphed from one of stoic intent to one drowning in thoughtful contemplation, his eyes beckoning some internal turmoil rumbling away beneath the surface.

“This sounds less like a tutelage on dueling, and more like instructions for when you’re driven to the last resort.” He offered with disappointment.

“Precisely.” I nodded. “The idea is that if you’ve reached a point where you’re left unarmed and fighting, then something’s already gone terribly wrong.”

 acknowledged this with a series of slow nods, his hand gripping the bottom of his snout as he did so.

“And… melee weapons?”

“Oh, right, there’s this.” I acknowledged with a nod, and a quick draw of the Mark XIV multipurpose combat and utility knife. “Fourth generation composalite with a leading monomolecular diamond edge.” 

 stared at the blade with a quirk of his brow, looking not too impressed by, well… everything about it.

However, that expression soon shifted to one of contemplative realization, returning to the very face he’d led this conversation with in the first place.

“So you really have abandoned the notion of melee weapons as a primary offensive tool.” He whispered under his breath, the implications of which prompted him to lock his gaze onto my pistol with increasing intensity. 

“Yeah. No offense to you and your arts, of course, but swords and melee weapons have been obsolete in our realm for the better part of a millennium.” I acknowledged frankly. “It’s just… no longer an effective killing tool. At least, not when stacked up against the sorts of weapons I’ve shown you.” I quickly added. “And in conflicts, that’s kinda what counts, right?” 

“Along with the capacity to maintain said weapons of war. Capability is meaningless without sustainability or scale.”  reasoned. “Though… if what you stated weeks ago was anything to go by…” He trailed off, allowing me to address that particular point. 

“Sustainability, logistics, and scale are the hallmarks of what makes modern warfare, well… modern.” I answered plainly. “So everything I said in that conversation wasn’t posturing, but an abject fact.” I shivered just referencing that conversation, especially given its preceding context — the null fight — was still as fresh in my mind as the day I’d faced it down. “There’s enough guns in my realm to arm every human currently living a hundred times over, and that’s not to mention the ammunition…”

“But surely that’s accumulative—”

“It is! But it wouldn’t really take too much to churn them out either. We have the industrial capacity to probably flood the entire surface of a realm in guns if we wanted to.” I paused, before letting out an awkward chuckle, once more reaching the back of my head awkwardly in order to defuse the situation. “That’s… not a hyperbole. Practically speaking, we could do it. But just because we could doesn’t mean we will.”

’s face reflected the same ghostly visage he’d shown on that day, as his features quickly darkened along with his tone of voice. “But you could.”

“Yeah, we could. But like I said, we probably won’t have a need to.” I attempted to calm the situation down some. “I mean, unless the Nexus really gives us a reason to… but I doubt that’ll ever happen.” I offered sarcastically. 

To which  could only reply with a weary smile.

“So to confirm what you said previously, every soldier in your realm, every man-at-arms and void legionnaire, every sailor and flyer, all of them—”

“Go through some form of BCT, in which all of them are trained in the art of the gun, yeah.” I intercepted the man with a grin. 

Though it was clear his expressions were far less receptive, and more so mortified at the implications that came with this confirmation of what I’d only alluded to before.

“So you really have crossed the martial gap, all without once casting a single spell.” He reasoned, before once more narrowing his eyes. “And if your Void Diver Aunt is of any indication, not only have you crossed the gap in weapons, but likewise in conveyances too.”

“Yeah… but that’s a whole other story, .” I chuckled darkly. “Suffice it to say, engagement distances in modern warfare aren't measured in meters, but in kilometers and then some.” 

That comment seemed to cause the man to shudder even moreso. “Snipers engage enemies kilometers out at a time, same for frontline drone operators, and I’m not even going to get into remote—”

“I see, Emma.”  interjected warily. “I see.” He sighed. 

A moment of silence punctuated our little back and forth, before he finally elongated his blade, forming the longsword I’d seen only a few times before.

“So you have mastered the manaless art of breaching the martial gap, creating entirely novel forms of not just weaponry, but the arts and industries required to sustain and maintain it all.” 

“Yup, that’s right.” I nodded proudly.

“Then I must ask… with what you currently have at your disposal, do you feel as if your tactics and strategies will be viable in the long term?”

“Yup! In fact, every piece of equipment I have with me was chosen just for that specific task. It’s the whole reason why they chose this specific model of armor to use as the base for my mission, despite it not being the most advanced or up-to-date. This logic extends to my gun, the ZNK-19, and every piece of tech I have with me. So the production of caseless ammo? Completely viable if not a non-issue whatsoever.” 

“But that requires the use of your larger equipment, no? Your tent, your… manaless microfactoriums.”

“Indeed.” I nodded.

” “ you showed that those firespears could supposedly be used to deploy people to the void and other realms . internally , i had theorized that they could likewise be repurposed for the deployment of soldiers to any point within a realm . a sort of void legion , or perhaps even a void diver of sorts. ” i paused , blinking rapidly at the excitable lupinor who i could only at . “ i mean… you aren ’ t too far off in your assumptions ,  . our firespears , even in that era , were also weaponized. ” i admitted . “ i just didn ’ t have time to include that in our presentation since explaining the void was much more of a priority. ” i trailed off , garnering a narrowing gaze from the lupinor . “ . however , i would a glimpse at such weapons in the future , if that is at all possible. ” “ yeah , sure , i ’ ll… put that on the list of presentations when we get to it. ” i offered , prompting an equally nod before the lupinor moved onto another topic entirely . “ forgive me if this is to ask , but considering your aunt ’ s service , am i to assume that you belong to a lineage of warriors and soldiers ? ” the lupinor questioned , raising a hand to rub the bottom of his snout as he did so . “ i mean , it ’ s somewhat of a tradition , one that members of my aunt ’ s side of the family tend to take on sporadically . but it isn ’ t enforced or anything if that ’ s what you ’ re asking. ” “ i see. ”  nodded , a glint of some deep thought behind those eyes . “ you will have to tell me more about your aunt in the future , emma , as as her exploits as this… void diver of sorts . provided , of course , that she ’ s seen active service. ” “ oh , she definitely has. ” i chuckled cockily . “ if anything , she ’ s quite literally the most well-decorated veteran in living memory . considering she ’ s participated in practically every major engagement in a flashpoint in one of our realms . the one and only to have erupted in our otherwise three centuries of uninterrupted peace. ”  raised an brow at that , a fangy forming soon after . “ i can start to see why your people chose you to be their candidate , emma. ” ===== the transgracian academy for the arts . hall of champions . liring ’ s training stadium . local time : 1557 hours . emma we arrived at the hall to an audience of one . meeting a certain felinor who , after much , approved us for a private booking of one of the smaller halls to the side of the main stadium . however , her to us at first stemmed less from our intent to spar , but a more pertinent still in her mind . “ and you are certain that you have fully healed , cadet emma— ” i addressed the professor ’ s with a movement of my pinkie , bending it to within its natural , before reaching it out to her much to her surprise . “ i pinkie it , professor. ” the professor paused for a moment , before simply going with the flow and completing the foreign gesture with a pinkie claw . “ is this the of some panacea , or a result of your natural regeneration abilities , cadet emma booker ? ” she pointedly asked . “ a little bit of column a and a little bit of column b i suppose. ” i answered coyly , causing the felinor to simply let out a sigh before donning a , one which was barely able to hide the curiosity behind those slitted pupils . “ very . i ’ t take much more of your time cadet booker . prince havenbrock. ” she turned to face  for a moment , dipping her head slightly in . “ if you need me , i will be in the stadium ’ s offices. ” with that , the professor quite literally leaped away , disappearing into the rafters to the tune of a mana radiation and the whirring of the calibrating waid . at which point , i was reminded to quickly address the elephant in the room , before it became too large of a talking point during the spar . “ evi ? ” “ yes , cadet booker ? ” “ training mode , on . active assists , off . save for the bare minimum of actual mitigation countermeasures , of course. ” “ acknowledged. ” if this was to be a training session , then i needed the evi ’ s active assists deactivated . otherwise , there really wouldn ’ t be a point to this .  no time in speed-walking us to the smaller training stadium , opening those two sliding oak doors to reveal what was , by all measures , a cross between one of those traditional dojos and a high school basketball court . the vibes and general aesthetic definitely fit the former , what with the heavy use of wood for the floors , pillars , and rafters . however , the presence of bleachers , stands , and lighting equipment alongside the iron scaffolding gave it an undeniably ‘ ’ aesthetic that was to . the space certainly was more for a one-on-one session , though , as the size wasn ’ t anywhere near as as the big open stadium it was connected to . “ i ’ d be remiss if i did not address a fundamental disconnect between our two peoples , emma. ”  began as he strode his way up and through one the bleachers , navigating us through to the center of the gymnasium . “ the proverbial wyvern in the nursery , so to speak. ” he continued as he moved closer towards me before deploying a privacy screen . “ a tool — nay , a weapon — that grants commoners the ability to from a hundred paces. ” the lupinor stopped , gesturing at the distance between us . “ bridging the martial gap , in a way that only mages and the can . without once making use of , neither inherent nor enchanted. ” he finished his statement , raising his hand and extending a single index finger whilst clenching the rest of his , as if in an attempt to mimic the shape of my pistol . “ the martial gap ? ” i parroted , unclasping my holster in the process . “ aye , that which separates commoners from nobles , a fundamental crux rendering their attempts at completely null and void — distance. ” the prince elaborated , taking the time to walk circles around me with his hands clasped firmly behind his back . “ physical distance is what underpins the martial gap , a functional spurred on by a ’ s inherent natural advantages. ” “ ranged attacks. ” i offered bluntly . “ precisely. ”  acknowledged , before once more stretching out his arm . “ a ’ s capabilities in war are only by their imagination . whilst those in their service , be they chosen ones or men-at-arms , would be provided the training or weapons necessary for accomplishing much of the same , albeit to an admittedly lesser capacity. ” the prince paused , halting his walk as he did so . “ roads to power , both and , can be traced to and those that wield it . for those without , their fates are sealed — sidelined to by of their inefficacy. ” he let out a sigh , raising both arms out to his sides . “ for even if a hundred , a thousand , or ten thousand commoners were to march towards a castle ’ s walls… they would be , drowned , , subsumed , or imploded before once setting their eyes on their intended adversary. ” “ and even those with weapons all rely on mages not only for their production but also for their fuel , upkeep , and maintenance. ” i , crossing my arms as i did so . “ . which is what i wished to address next — that the martial gap applies to matters beyond the functional disparity of distance , but is also a term applied to the inherent gap that naturally arises as a result of this status quo. ” i exhaled at that . as despite  simply reinforcing what i ’ d already out , it just felt… to hear it all laid out so , as a named principle at that . “ your kind , despite , have created a weapon of breaching that gap . not just physically , but in every sense of the word. ”  continued , his features stiffening if only for a moment , as it was something was currently spooling up behind those yellow eyes . “ now tell me , exactly what did your training entail ? ” he transitioned , as if trying to steer away from a subject matter that was bound to crop up eventually . “ well… my training wasn ’ t exactly what you ’ d call typical. ” i began frankly . “ for starters , i was run through an unconventional combo of basic combat training and individual training tailored just for this mission , while also taking class hours for stuff typically reserved for officer candidate school . bct typically takes six months , followed by anywhere from six months to a year for ait , but— ” “ i meant the actual contents of your training , emma. ”  interjected , letting out a sigh as he did so . “ oh , , . yeah , so , most of it was accelerated bct . so stuff physical training , small arms weapons instruction and drilling— ” “ small arms ? ”  quickly interrupted . “ as you might expect , we have a lot of weapons types that have spawned over the years. ” i pulled out my gun for emphasis . “ the sheer of weapons required an equally diverse classification system in order to categorize them as a result . with small arms eventually coming to encompass any individual-use firearm that does not require the use of partially powered or fully powered exoskeletons to function to their fullest capability. ”  blinked rapidly , before once more narrowing his eyes in . “ you mentioned exoskeletons. ”  inquired . “ a-are you implying your people are in some way… arachnous or insectoid— ” “ oh , nonono . by exoskeletons , i basically mean this— ” i paused , gesturing at my armor for emphasis . “ it ’ s a system of… well… machines , basically . machines that clamp all around a user in order to and their strength by the power of mechanical force ! ” i beamed . “ as such , what i meant was that there are some weapons that functionally as small arms , but are only ever for individuals wearing some form of exoskeleton-assist kits. ”  ’ s didn ’ t fully subside however , though he seemed to just run with it for the time being . “ and what happens if one uses one of these weapons without the aid of an… exoskeleton ? ” “ the will dislocate or your shoulder and/or wrist. ” i replied bluntly , causing the prince to blink rapidly in response . “ as you can imagine , firing a traditional chem-kinetic weapon comes with the caveat of force being generated . so… the larger the explosion in the gun , the more kickback you ’ ll expect. ” i shrugged . “ i see. ”  responded . “ i… assume the next category up from ‘ small arms ’ to be ‘ large ’ arms , and perhaps ‘ medium ’ arms too , yes ? ” “ erm… ” i paused yet again , reaching for the back of my neck in preparation for the explanation to come . “ the next ‘ step up ’ as it were , is actually light weapons. ” that answer prompted the lupinor to simply stare at me blankly , his mouth curling up in a fit of . “ but we started with small arms— ” “ the next step up following light weapons is heavy weapons , if that helps any. ” i smiled awkwardly . “ of course it is. ” the prince acknowledged with a breath , gripping the bridge of his snout in the process . “ i apologize for our conversation . i was not anticipating , nor at all , for another semantics lesson . to no of your own , of course. ” the prince let out a sigh , before gesturing towards me with a single hand . “ let us return to our original line of discussion. ” “ so , yeah , small arms training . i had plenty of that , along with light and heavy weapons training in accordance with my power armored specialist , or apas certification. ” i inhaled deeply , steadying myself for a rapid-fire delivery of mil-spec jargon . “ then there was equipment training because of the power armor , along with electronic operation ’ s training as a baseline requisite , tactics and strategy training , battlefield drone and recon training , expedited forward operations training , and of course , there was also close quarters combat , or cqc training. ” while the lupinor ’ s attentiveness waned with each piece of jargon , it was that latter category that prompted  to perk up and chime in . “ and this… close quarters combat , i assume it is a sort of martial art ?

# 1. Bang for your buck

A shotgun is the most affordable long gun you can buy that has a significant amount of stopping power. Based on my limited research, you can buy a very reliable Maverick 88 12 gauge shotgun for $250 at Sportsman's Warehouse. If you want to buy a rifle with comparable muzzle energy at the same store, the closest option I found was a single shot rifle chambered in .350 Legend for $330. The next step up is a bolt action rifle in a similar cartridge, and those start at $350 for the cheapest models and go up from there while a somewhat decent AR-15 chambered in 5.56 NATO costs around $400-$500. You can buy single shot 12 gauge shotguns for around $100 if you're really strapped for cash, but if you can afford the Maverick 88, you should probably buy that instead.

# 2. Versatility

You can use a shotgun to kill just about every huntable animal in North America just by changing the ammo you use. Going after doves? A target load intended for skeet with 7.5 birdshot will do. Going after pheasants or rabbits? #4 birdshot could work for that. What about ducks? #2 shot in the non toxic shot of your choice. Turkey? A heavy load of #5 shot lead or #9 shot in tungsten/TSS. Coyote? #4 buckshot. Deer? 00 buckshot or slugs. Black bear or even grizzly bear? The spiciest slug that your wallet or shoulder can tolerate. You can also swap out the chokes to make the gun more effective for closer engagements or longer engagements. With some guns, you can install a rifled barrel that can make it a formidable weapon for relatively close range hunting scenarios for bigger game using slugs.

# 3. Increased hit probability

Yes, there are rat shot rounds that you can get pistol calibers from CCI, but they often use very small birdshot and the rifling of pistols/rifles spread out the shot a lot. So, those types of rounds or only effective for shooting small game/pests at very close ranges. Shooting at moving and/or small targets with a rifle or a pistol can be difficult, but with a shotgun, those tasks are much more doable.

# 4. Legal in places with stricter gun control laws

Let's say that you just moved to New York state. You didn't bring any guns with you and decide that you need to buy a good gun for home defense ASAP. Due to local laws, handguns and semi automatic rifles require a permit to possess, and permits usually take time and money to obtain. On the other hand, shotguns, even those of the semi automatic variety, do not require permits to purchase and possess in the state of New York.

# 5. Less over penetration for home defense, target shooting and hunting

When loaded with the right ammunition, the shotgun may be the best long gun to use for home defense if you're concerned about accidentally shooting your neighbor in a dense suburban neighborhood, an apartment building or a townhome complex. There are hollow point ammo options for rifles and pistol caliber carbines that can significantly reduce over penetration concerns. However, the shotgun has more options for home defense that may penetrate even less than rifle and pistol ammo, whether it's using smaller buckshot, some type of birdshot, bean bag rounds or rock salt ammunition.

Paul Harrell has produced some excellent videos discussing the subject of shotguns for home defense and which shotgun ammo may be best for that purpose, I'll post a few of those videos below.

Certain areas are closed to hunting for rifles but are open to shotguns and muzzleloaders only.

In a similar vein, you can have clay shooting ranges relatively close to busy highways with no berm necessary while such a set up would be impossible for pistol and rifle ranges without a significant berm set up and/or space for the bullets to travel if one goes over the berm.

# 6. Fun factor

This point is more subjective, but I think it's still worth mentioning. There's something special about loading and shooting a pump action shotgun. I have a pump action rifle, and it just doesn't hit the same as my pump action shotgun. It's fun to see/predict shotgun patterns for birdshot/buckshot. Last but not least, clay shooting might be the most entertaining/rewarding shooting sport and one of the more affordable ones.

# 7. Ease of handloading

Should you choose to get into it, you can reload a shotgun shell using more limited/affordable tools than handloading pistol and rifle cartridges. I also feel like there's less of a learning curve too as long as you take the proper precautions unique to shotshell reloading. Another major benefit of shotshell reloading is that while brass goblins almost always scrounge for pistol and rifle brass, I have never encountered a shotshell goblin in person yet. In a pinch, you can load just about anything that will fit into a shotgun shell, whether it's rocks, double A batteries, bubble gum and so on for fun or in survival situations where resources are limited.

***OK, now let's discuss the downsides just to be fair. Shotguns can have high recoil, expensive and/or rare ammunition, limited ammo capacity, slow and awkward reloads and limited range. But to raise some counterpoints to some of those concerns, .410 shotguns have a lot less recoil than 12 gauge shotguns, recoil pads and low recoil ammo exist, you can find good deals on shotgun shells if you know where to look and lots of practice can make shotgun reloads quicker and more natural.***

***Typically, I would not recommend a brand new gun owner buy a shotgun for their first gun because of some of the reasons listed above.***

[https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/1kvk9zm/8\_reasons\_shotguns\_are\_overrated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/1kvk9zm/8_reasons_shotguns_are_overrated/)","7 reasons why every liberal gun owner should own a shotgun now that you 've read past the somewhat clickbaity title , let me see if i can convince you to get a shotgun if you have not already . # 1. bang for your buck a shotgun is the most long gun you can buy that has a amount of stopping power . based on my research , you can buy a very maverick 88 12 gauge shotgun for $ 250 at sportsman 's warehouse . if you want to buy a rifle with comparable muzzle energy at the same store , the closest option i found was a single shot rifle chambered in .350 legend for $ 330 . the next step up is a bolt action rifle in a similar cartridge , and those start at $ 350 for the models and go up from there while a somewhat ar-15 chambered in 5.56 nato costs around $ 400- $ 500 . you can buy single shot 12 gauge shotguns for around $ 100 if you 're really strapped for cash , but if you can the maverick 88 , you should probably buy that instead . # 2. you can use a shotgun to just about every huntable animal in north america just by changing the ammo you use . going after doves ? a target load intended for skeet with 7.5 birdshot will do . going after pheasants or rabbits ? # 4 birdshot could for that . what about ducks ? # 2 shot in the non shot of your choice . turkey ? a heavy load of # 5 shot or # 9 shot in tungsten/tss . coyote ? # 4 buckshot . deer ? 00 buckshot or slugs . black bear or even grizzly bear ? the spiciest that your wallet or shoulder can tolerate . you can also swap out the chokes to make the gun more for closer engagements or longer engagements . with some guns , you can install a rifled barrel that can make it a weapon for relatively close range hunting scenarios for bigger game using slugs . # 3. increased hit probability yes , there are rat shot rounds that you can get pistol calibers from cci , but they often use very small birdshot and the rifling of pistols/rifles spread out the shot a lot . so , those types of rounds or only for shooting small game/pests at very close ranges . shooting at moving and/or small targets with a rifle or a pistol can be , but with a shotgun , those tasks are much more doable . # 4. legal in places with stricter gun control laws let 's say that you just moved to new york state . you did n't bring any guns with you and decide that you need to buy a gun for home defense asap . due to local laws , handguns and semi automatic rifles require a permit to possess , and permits usually take time and money to obtain . on the other hand , shotguns , even those of the semi automatic , do not require permits to purchase and possess in the state of new york . # 5. less over penetration for home defense , target shooting and hunting when loaded with the ammunition , the shotgun may be the long gun to use for home defense if you 're about accidentally shooting your neighbor in a suburban neighborhood , an apartment building or a townhome . there are point ammo options for rifles and pistol caliber carbines that can significantly reduce over penetration . however , the shotgun has more options for home defense that may penetrate even less than rifle and pistol ammo , whether it 's using smaller buckshot , some type of birdshot , bean bag rounds or rock salt ammunition . paul harrell has produced some videos discussing the subject of shotguns for home defense and which shotgun ammo may be for that purpose , i 'll post a few of those videos below .

https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1kjktc1/are_servitors_mainly_vatgrown_or_made_from_living/,gun control is necessary,"Are Servitors mainly vat-grown, or made from living humans? What the lore actually says","**TLDR: There is no basis to claim the majority of Servitors are vat-grown. The lore generally showcases that there are large proportions of both natural and vat-grown Servitors. The only explicit statement we have states a greater proportion are made from natural humans. I survey the relevant lore across the decades.**

A bit of a minor issue (which grew into a lengthy post), but I wanted to clarify something which is a surprisingly frequent topic of conversation – and which is inevitably accompanied by people making unsupported and incorrect claims.

Hopefully we are all aware of Servitors: the mind-wiped (though not always totally successfully…) cyborg automatons which are ubiquitous across most of the Imperium, undertaking a wide range of tasks.

But where do the bodies used to produce Servitors come from? Are they mainly vat-grown for the purpose? Or are the bodies and/or corpses of naturally-born people (which I will refer to as ‘organic’) the main source?

If you look at discussions about Servitors which appear on this sub and elsewhere, a lot of people claim – very confidently – that it is the former: that the majority (or, sometimes, it is even claimed, the vast majority) of Servitors are vat-grown. But there is not really any basis in the lore to support such a claim.

The clearest statement we have about the ratio of Servitors produced from vat-grown or once living people is:

>Most Servitors are manufactured by the Adeptus Mechanicus, either from genetically-engineered humanoid clones created for the purpose, **or more commonly from criminals sentenced to Servitude Imperpituis**, in which case their minds are wiped during processing.

>*Imperium Maledictum Core Rulebook* (2023), p. 322.

So, it is stated that the use of criminals is more common than vat-grown clones.

Most often, we are just told that there are a mix of vat-grown bodies and people being turned into Servitors, with no real info about the ratio – just a sense that both methods are common.

The most extensive account (well, that I have found anyway) is:

>Through ancient covenants with the Emperor himself, the adepts of the Cult Mechanicus have a monopoly on and jurisdiction over the use of all technology. To alter a machine’s prescribed operation or structure, to interfere with its inner workings without proper theological ministrations only a Tech Priest is privy to, are just some of the crimes for which the Adeptus Mechanicus is privileged to administer punishment. Lobotomised servitors – men and women who ran afoul of Tech Priests – are a  common sight throughout the Imperium. These unthinking creatures, heavily modified with bionic replacements, perform menial and repetitive tasks of every kind, and heir unhealthy pallor and slack jaws are a potent reminder of the dangers of crossing the Adeptus Mechanicus.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 11.

And:

>Raw Materials

>The careful and reverent reclamation of a fallen servitor’s mechanical components stands in sharp contrast to the ready destruction of its damaged flesh.

>…

>Whether servitors are expected to survive a day, a month, or longer, their creators know that there is an endless supply of replacement material to build another.

>The Creation Rites of Manifest Indenture lay down screed-covenants for the making of servitors, but they vary greatly not only from forge world to forge world, but from one temple to another and from one idiosyncratic Tech-Priest to the next. A number of servitors are built upon a base of vat-grown bodies of flesh and blood, typically Human but occasionally creatures of other lineages. These fully grown men and women are produced in large-scale batches on most forge worlds, matured in bubbling casks of artificial gene-gruel. The ready supply of naturally born Human from many other sources, however, means that few forge worlds every rely solely on growing such anthrostratum as some term it.

>Many other servitors were once criminals accused of any one of the Imperium’s byzantine and ruthlessly enforced laws 0 from low-born black marketeers, to outmanoeuvred members of the political elite, or Inquisitorial enforces who saw too much. Others are those who fall foul of the Cult Mecahnicus’ own oppressive codes against tech heresy. Some institutions or planets have longstanding agreements with forge words in their vicinity, handing over prisoners condemned under a wide variety of jurisdictions and for countless crimes. The Ecclesiarchy, the Adeptus Arbites, and planetary governors are just some of those who generate large numbers of soon-to-be servitors. Some of the freshly converted thralls return to those who judged them, serving both as unthinking slaves and visible warnings to others.

>Still other servitors were once people in the wrong place at the wrong time, taken, screaming, and remade to serve. Deserted frontier towns and emptied hab-blocks are frequent discoveries after one of a forge world’s Explorator fleets pass through a system. Few of those the Adeptus Mechanicus harvest are missed, and its political power means those who are will rarely be avenged. Tales also abound of people throwing themselves before a procession of Tech-Priests, begging to be reforged into a servitor. Some are religious zealots, either adherents to the Cult Mechanicus already or hoping to serve the Emperor in as ascetic or humble a manner as possible. Some instead seek escape from the misery and fear of Imperial life and believe that, once changed by the Tech-Priests, memory and pain will be blessedly erased.

>Whatever their origin, they are given a chance to provide the Imperium with a more useful servant. Each individual is mind-wiped, surgically and chemically lobotomised so that their memories are a blank slate – in theory at least., for there are harrowing tales of servitors retaining vestiges of consciousness without any means of communicating the horror of their new existence.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 23-24.

So, while vat-grown bodies are commonly used, a wide range of people are turned into Servitors too, whether due to being declared criminals (often likely spurious or unfair), due to reciprocal arrangements between other Imperial institutions and the Ad mech, or just the sheer bad luck of the Ad Mech scooping you up and then scooping out some of your brains.

We also get a sense of the various groups who utilize servitors, and those who are unfortunate to be turned into them, in a range of other sources:

>Multi-Task Servitor

>The Servitor is an essential part of Imperial life, a cybernetic construct entrusted with all manner of dangerous, repetitive, or menial tasks. **They are also a dire warning; many Servitors are vat-grown clones, but many are — or were — criminals, mind-wiped and sentenced to unending labour**. They can communicate verbally, but in a minimal fashion, as their higher brain functions are lost to augmetic replacements or stripped as punishment. Advanced models capable of serving as Familiars retain higher brain functions and perhaps the knowledge and skills they possessed before conversion. Any idiosyncrasies are merely ingrained nerve reflexes, or so the Tech-Priests claim.

>*Imperium Maledictum Inquisition Player’s Guide* (2024), p. 113.

And:

>In the grim darkness of the far future, there are many fates worse than death for a man. For those who believe in the sanctity of the body and soul, being mind-wiped and re-purposed as a servitor ranks high among them. Servitors are lobotomised, drooling automatons whose bodies have been augmented and outfitted for a single task. In the case of a Combat Servitor, this is to act as a mobile weapons platform. **While the human components of some Servitors are grown in vats, and others are the bodies of deserving criminals, that is not the extent of the horror of the universe most Imperial citizens live in. Vagrants, the downtrodden and the unlucky, all are candidates for Servitors.** Some well connected crime lords and tyrants turn those who have failed them into Servitors by way of punishment, others do it because they believe death does not represent the end of service. There are even records of Imperial Commanders making servitors from their mortally wounded warriors as some sort of twisted reward, allowing them to continue to fight in the Emperor’s name.

>*Wrath & Glory Core Rulebook* (2018), p. 411.

And:

>**While many servitors are adapted from artificially cultured drone bodies, others are the remains of humans who have committed some terrible crime.** The most severe punishment for a criminal in the Imperium is not death – that would be wasteful and hardly serve as a useful deterrent. Instead, the convicted are turned into servitors. The malefactor is first mind-wiped and then augmented and reprogrammed to perform some rudimentary function too tedious even for the menials of the Adeptus Administratum. Ex-convicts who become servitors wear a brass plate upon their body proclaiming their crime, as a warning to all who would transgress against the laws of the Emperor or the Omnissiah.

>Unlike the ignominious fate of criminals, the fate of those who die in honoured service to the Emperor is sometimes to be allowed to continue their labours in the form of a servo-skull.

>*Warhammer 40k Rulebook* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 280.

And, one which perhaps implies vat-grown may be more commonly used on Forgeworlds (due to the use of the word “supplemented”), but isn’t totally clear:

>The organic material used in the creation of these programmable slaves are sourced partly from growing vats on forge worlds, as well as supplemented from Imperial penitentiaries from across the galaxy.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 41.

And:

>THE MERCY OF THE OMNISSIAH

>The servitor complement of even a single forge world will typically number in the tens of millions. **Many were once wanted criminals – hard and intimidating men from all walks of Imperial life, from hive gangers stitched with vat-grown slabs of muscle to Inquisitorial enforcers that committed bloody murder after learning too much. When the Adeptus Arbites find a transgressor of surpassing physical size, that individual will be beaten senseless with power mauls and sent battered and bloody to the nearest forge world. There he is given a second chance to serve Mankind as one of its most faithful servants. First the specimen is mindwiped, chemically lobotomised so that his personality and memories are a blank slate – in theory at least**. Next his arms are cut away, usually replaced with weapons or tools suited to the new role his masters have chosen for him. In the case of battle servitors, the specimen will be halved at the abdomen and permanently sutured into a tracked motive unit. His mind will be hardwired with targeting computers, and his voice box surgically modified to better sing binharic praise to the Machine God. The process is of course painful in the extreme, but then no atonement is every truly complete without sacrifice.

>*Codex: Cult Mechanicus* 7^(th) ed. (2015), p. 48. (Also reprinted word-for word in the 8^(th) ed. Codex on page 46).

And:

>Servitor Drone

>**Ubiquitous throughout the Imperium, servitors are lobotomised cyborgs or vat-grown beings programmed to fulfil a variety of functions**. The most common are monotasked drones, slaved to perform simple tasks ranging from operating a noble’s autocarriage to scribing judicial proceedings. Some are so specialised that they are permanently hardwired in place, as in the case of lift-operators and pilot servitors

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 396.

And:

>Servitor

>**A servitor is an automaton whose controlling components are organic and mostly human in origin. Some are grown in vats, while others are formed from the aged bodies of honoured tech-priests or despised criminals whose punishment is to serve the Imperium in this fashion**. The process of creating a servitor purges higher brain functions and psychic pattern of the subject, rendering him a blank slate for reprogramming. The most common forms of servitor are mindless labour drones, dedicated to a small selection of simple tasks, and fitted with devices necessary to this toil. Some are not even mobile, being built into the machinery they control.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook* (2009), p. 146.

And:

>**Servitors are fusions of flesh and machine made from culture-grown organics, harvested corpses, or mindwiped human bodies**. Millions of these cyborg creations are found throughout the Imperium and human space, used to perform monotonous functions without deviation or question. Servitor technology is said to predate the Imperium itself and is the exclusive purview of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Servitors come in a seemingly endless variety of forms from baroque works of art designed to tend the needs of the rich and powerful, to crude, misshapen labour units fashioned for work in the most horrific industrial zones, to bellicose monsters of steel meant as near-mindless living weapons. The most common use of servitors is to perform mundane tasks such as waiting on nobles, routine maintenance, loading freight, sorting endless dockets, or tirelessly guarding a given locale.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook* (2009), p. 374.

And:

>Servitors are fusions of flesh and machine made from culture-grown organics, harvested corpses, or mind-wiped human bodies.

>*Only War Core Rulebook* (2012), p. 372.

And:

>Culturally, the Imperium is far more acclimatised to the idea of heavily cyberised systems that incorporate organic parts, with the trepanned crania of criminals and animals emptied for use as the control systems of heavy machinery, weapons, and vessels.

>Servitors — lobotomised, cyberised, and repurposed criminals or cultured organic organisms are ubiquitous across the entirety of human space, and most citizens of the Imperium hardly spare them a second glance.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 72.

And, going back to not long after they were first introduced:

>Many Servitors are adapted from artificially cultured drone bodies; others are mind-wiped humans who have committed some terrible crime.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 45.

We are also told this:

>The greater mass of Martians are worker-slaves called Servitors. Servitors are not really fully human, but half-man half-machine creatures whose minds have been partially programmed to perform specific duties.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 45.

And notion that Servitors constitute the bulk of the population of forge worlds more generally has appeared in earlier quotes, but is also stated here too:

>The overwhelming majority of any forge world's population are made up of servitors, ranging in form and function from monotask mining cyborgs and holomats (holographic recording units), to Gun Servitors and armoured Praetorians.

>*Dark Heresy: The Lathe Worlds* (2012), p. 11.

And:

>The servitor complement of even a single forge world typically numbers in the tens, or even hundreds of millions, outnumbering Skitarii and Tech-Priests many times over. Especially ancient or powerful forge worlds, such as Mars itself, are supported by several times that number.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 24.

I have seen people argue that this means that most Servitors must be vat-grown, otherwise how could there be so many of them on forge worlds? Well, given everything we are told about how many people are designated for servitorization by various institutions or how willing the Ad Mech are to just nab whole communities, there are reasons provided to help explain this (whether someone personally buys into them is another matter, of course). And powerful forgeworlds like Mars will be having far more deals with other planets and institutions, and far more resources fed into them.

We also get some more specific details about different imperial organizations acquire and make use of Servitors. Starting with Space Marines, the 2^(nd) edition *Codex: Ultramarines* (which kind of served as the Codex for all ‘vanilla’ Chapters at the time) reprinted this from *Codex Imperialis*:

>Servitors are created by the Techmarines as assistants and servants. They are weird combinations of men and machines, bio-engineered by the Techmarines to perform specific tasks. **Their bodies are grown from human gene-cells in vats of artificial nutrient**, and although physically strong and robust their minds are blank and incapable of development or of feeling much pain. Techmarines insert bio-programs into their Servitors’ brains, and replace parts of their bodies with mechanical contrivances such as huge metal claws, infra-red sensors for eyes, or whatever other specialised tools are required.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 22; *Codex: Ultramarines* 2^(nd) ed. (1995), p. 50.

Which, does suggest that all Servitors used by Space Marine Chapters were, at that point in the lore, grown for purpose. Of course, contradictions abound in 40k lore, so later we get:

>**The creation mysteries for Servitors vary from Chapter to Chapter. Some are grown from human gene-cells in artificial nutrient. Others are failed neophytes, civilian criminals or fugitives from Chapter law who have been mind-wiped and lobotomised so that their flesh may serve anew**.

>…

>Though essential to the maintenance of a Chapter's mechanical devices, Servitors rarely enjoy anything save indifference from the Space Marines they serve. In most Chapters, the Servitors are ignored by all but the Techmarines, treated as would any other machine or piece of equipment. In others they are treated with revulsion, considered necessary but abhorrences that pervert the spirit and the flesh of man. Conversely, in a very few Space Marine Chapters, generally those with strong ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus, Servitors are regarded as having achieved spiritual union with the Omnissiah. In such Chapters, Servitors are biomechanoid shrines, revered almost as greatly as other artefacts, their words sifted and analysed for hints of prophecy and guidance from the Machine God. Those Space Marines who follow these arcane practices believe that in so doing they are brought closer to the Omnissiah. To other Chapters, such behaviour is thought distasteful to the point of heresy and regarded with hostility and suspicion. What the Servitors think of all this - if indeed they even notice - no one knows.

>*Codex: Space Marines 5th ed.* (2008), p. 72.

And:

>A servitor is an automaton whose controlling components are organic and mostly human in origin. Some are grown in vats, while others are formed from failed recruits or civilian criminals whose sentence is an un-life of service to the Imperium’s heroes. The process of creating a servitor purges higher brain functions and psychic patterns of the subject, rendering him a blank slate for reprogramming.

>*Deathwatch Core Rulebook* (2010), p. 172.

So, again, a mix between vat-grown and more ‘organic’ sources.

As regards the Ad Mech and forgeworlds, we get told:

>A forge world’s undisputed masters are the Magi of the Cult Mechanicus, who rule with harsh precision and cold logic. To them, the human menials of their domains are little more than cogs and gears in the great machine, resources to be measured, graded, and used to fit their worth. At their direction, the bulk of a forge world’s population is utilised as a skilled and trained labour force, whilst the brightest and best are inducted to the Adeptus Mechanicus itself. The more militant are chosen for the Skitarii Tech-guard. **Those deemed unworthy or irredeemable are fated to be “recycled” into servitor components, and indeed, servitors and drones often far outnumber a forge world’s free-willed population. Such is the price of failure**.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook*, p. 19.

This notion of those deemed unworthy being servitorised is reiterated elsewhere, as is the idea that those who break rules regarding technology and knowledge are also turned into Servitors:

>A forge world Homeworld Origin is a great starting point for any Acolyte who wishes to begin his career in the dank, cramped, and polluted worlds of the Lathes. Life within a forge world is exceptionally difficult, and only the hardy and strong survive. Those who show any signs of weakness are cast out, or worse, repurposed into mindless Servitors, forever destined to a menial existence of endless repetition.

>*Dark Heresy: Lathe Worlds, Lost Dataslate* (2012), p. 4.

And:

>SERVITORS

>Those without the capacity for knowledge and those who betray the secrets entrusted to them by the Tech-Priests are re-purposed into living machines by the Cult Mechanicus.

>*Dark Heresy: The Lathe Worlds* (2012), p. 11.

We also have an interesting note about one specific type of Servitor used by the Ad Mech, in form of Kataphron Breachers:

>Many of the fleshy components of servitors are vat-grown, but it was soon discovered that these artificial organics were unable to bond properly with the hulking machinery of the Kataphron Breacher. After some experimentation, it was found that the constructs only work properly when centred around the soul of what was not just a living man, but a particularly violent one.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 46.

And we told this about the attitude of Ad Mech staff on many space ships:

>Crew Reclamation Facility

>The Mechanicus has no qualms about converting the grievously wounded into servitors...but the rest of the crew may differ in opinion.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook*, p. 205.

If we turn to how servitorisation is used as a punishment for crimes, we can look at the role of the Adeptus Arbites. A general overview notes:

>In practice, the Arbitrators are tasked to punish criminal activity, root out cultists and illegal gatherings, eliminate organised gangs, and are often unleashed en mass to quell riots. They must be as willing to dispense justice as they are to pronounce it. Often the punishment will be a swift bullet to the brain (or the perpetrator will have expired during the process of apprehension and interrogation). **Other sentences, amongst the hundreds of thousands available, include flogging, limb amputation, exile to a prison world, condemnation to a penal legion, public execution, or conversion into a servitor**.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 8.

Looking more specifically at the situation in the Askellon Sector, after it being explained that rehabilitation for criminals is exceptionally rare, we are told:

>“Less rarely, a subject serves the God-Emperor in other ways, as servitor candidates or service within the Penal Legions of Kommitzar are always a viable punishment.”

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 42.

And we are told local Enforcers also use servitorisation as a punishment:

>It is the scavenger gangs who build the majority of criminal gear within the Calixis Sector: small gangs, acting alone, attempting to grab power or wealth for themselves. As they are more an underworld society than a unified criminal whole, the Adeptus Arbites spend vast resources to monitor these minor cells to prevent them from endangering the status quo. **While the arrest and punishment (often execution or service as a servitor) is left primarily to the planetary Enforcers**, it is not completely unheard of for an Arbitrator to find reason to apprehend a gang leader for his own purposes.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 78.

Next we can look at the fate of psykers who are taken by the Black Ships:

Many psykers die en route to Terra, but those who survive are rigorously tested to work out their best use. Upon reaching the Imperial home world, the psykers are sorted, graded and assigned to various duties. The vast majority are sent to the Astronomican to serve the great beacon – their lives are short, painful and culminate in an agonising death. **A goodly number are deemed too unstable even for that duty. Most of these are lobotomised, becoming mindless servitors**, but a few are spirited away to the Obsidian Keep in the heart of the Astra Telepathica palace complex where an unknown fate awaits them.

*Warhammer 40k Rulebook* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 39.

And the Ecclesiarchy also of course gets in on the action too:

>Automatons of the Holy Ordos are often made from human components and come in a variety of forms. However, they almost all have one thing in common – they were created using heretics as the basis. The Ministorum takes great delight in stripping heretics of their former personalities and will, and reprogramming them to have undying loyalty to the God-Emperor they once foreswore. An even better treat is to send these same heretics into battle to assist in eliminating other heretics and their corrupting ways.

>Arco-Flagellant.

>For those heretics found guilty of heresies insufficient severity to warrant immediate execution, there is another fate in store: arco-flagellation.

>*Dark Heresy: Blood of Martyrs* (2010), p. 122.

It’s not just the authorities who can turn people into Servitors either, as some gangs do so too:

>Tech Gangs

>Some gangs include actual servitors, mostly captured in upper-hive raids. A few create their own from lobotomised members with implanted and experimental augmentations. These rarely live long.

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 337.

And if we look at specific examples of Servitors being created and the materials used to do so across the lore, we see a mix of both vat-grown and ‘organic’ examples – with plenty, and likely more, of the latter.

We have the example of an Ad Mech group in Varangantua on the world of Alecto turining criminals into Servitors (and dabbling in some criminality and tech heresyw hile doing so…). More info on this and plenty of relevant quotes here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/13j2k97/excerpt\_flesh\_and\_steel\_the\_business\_and\_body/](https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/13j2k97/excerpt_flesh_and_steel_the_business_and_body/)

For our purposes, a key passage is:

>Naked human beings were standing in a switchbacked line between high fences. Outside the fences Adeptus Mechanicus menials in environment suits stood guard with shock goads in hand. The people, all mature men and women, were shepherded down the caged walk like livestock. And they were food beasts being led to the slaughter, meat for the ravenous appetite of the Machine-God.

>…

>The manufactorum produced servitors, but it was more akin to an abattoir than a workshop. Every surface was easily cleanable. Large plastek flaps divided areas from each other. Servitors with spray units surgically attached to their backs prowled about, hosing filth into slit drains set into the perfectly smooth, slanted floors. We walked above all this, past sentry pods on spikes occupied by galvanic rifle-armed snipers. Our path went from one end of the hall to the other, and I could see pretty much the whole sorting process, beginning to end.

>As the line slowly advanced, the people were passed through various scanning devices, most of them mounted in ugly, functional arches that let out a constant series of acceptance chimes. Occasionally, one would let out an angry blare, and the indicator lumens would flash red. The rejected person was then swallowed up by a trapdoor opening beneath their feet. From these pits wafted a hideous stench, and the grinding sounds of industrial mincers. One rejected man grabbed on to the lip and hung there, arms and hands bloodied, shouting a stream of defiant profanities. Guards lined the grating either side of him and shocked him until he fell. The adepts wouldn’t even waste bullets on these people.

>The trapdoor flipped up, and the next terrified person was ushered forward.

>A number of pneumatic gates separated the people from each part of the process, snapping open and shut with bone-crushing force.

>Violent metal arms snatched them up and spread-eagled them in the air, and a servitor shearer shaved them all over. At another they were subjected to a high-pressure counterseptic wash whose chemical stink made me choke from a hundred feet away. More scanners, more rejects winnowed out. Machines forcibly dressed them in the heavy rubberised garments common to all mono-tasked servitors. These were saggy on them, all one size, until another process force-shrank them to fit their bodies where metal cuffs, sockets and collars bit into vulnerable flesh. The last few prayers gave way to screams at that point, and even the most stoic shouted in pain. They were ushered over a floor buzzing with power that made them shriek with every footstep.

>*Flesh and Steel*.

An example of a deal to ship people into a forgeworld in return for resources:

>Throughout the Age of Imperium, Cerix Magnus has led the forge worlds of Askellon, entering into a number of reciprocal arrangements with other factions including several nearby Knight worlds. In return for the supply of weapons and other advanced materiel they manufacture, the numerous other worlds serve what needs it cannot meet itself. These range from raw natural resources vital to manufacturing, to Knights and other forces in times of armed conflict\*\*, to a supply of sinners to be converted into the many servitors each forge relies upon for its many tasks.\*\*

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 341.

And bounty hunters playing a role in the servitor production system:

>Desoleum Bounty Hunter

>In Hive Desoleum, bounty hunters do not hunt men—for a man is inconsequential and easily replaced. Rather, they hunt oaths. Fundamentally, the commission of a crime is a violation of a citizen’s oath to hive and master. Should a citizen compound his offence by fleeing justice, he takes with him his yet-unfulfilled oath. **It is the job of oath hunters to track and return them to complete their service— possibly as a servitor**.

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 384.

There was a deal between the Ecclesiarchy and Ad Mech to deal with overcrowding:

>As burial space on Granithor became precious due to crowding, the Ecclesiarchy looked to the moon as a means of dealing with ""lesser"" burials. At first, they began to ""dump"" unworthy aspirants, living as well as dead, on Donaris without ceremony or permission. Magos Artitaeus registered a formal complaint with the Sector Governor and the two sides met at the Scrobis Accords. Archbishop Sophatus, who represented the Ecclesiarchy at the Accords, was surprised that the Mechanicus not only accepted the situation, but insisted on including a clause requiring that all postulants turned away from Granithor be sent to Donaris and agreed that the dead should be placed in crypts that they would construct. They also stipulated an Ecclesiarchal enclave be created on the moon to monitor the Mechanicus' end of the arrangement, something that the Ministorum has subsequently come to view as a slap in the face. Leadership of the enclave has never been a popular position and is widely regarded as a mild punishment for past misdeeds.

>**The Mechanicus constructed the crypts as promised, but any living persons accompanying the dead — pall bearers and others of funeral parties — were evaluated for servitor production, and those found suitable... The Ecclesiarchy chafes under the concept that some members of their flock now fill the lowest ranks of the Omnissiah's congregation**, but the sheer volume of supplicants wishing to be buried on Granithor leaves them little choice but to accept the Accord's ""solution.""

>**The Mechanicus have steadily increased the size and scope of their facilities on Donaris ever since; and it is now one of the largest servitor production facilities outside of the Lathes**.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 118.

There is an example of the Adminstratum allowing the Ad Mech to turn farmers into Servitors to increase efficiency:

>Even the augmented forms of the Adeptus Mechanicus need sustenance, and after hearing of potential issues with harvests on Ostia, the Machine Cults of Avachrus engaged their cogitators and calculated a way to benefit. The Administratum gladly accepted the aid of their farming Servitors, even allowing them to convert the simple farmers into far more efficient lobotomised labourers, allowing the Adeptus Mechanicus to contest the power of the Ecclesiarchy on Ostia for the first time. But the earnest faith of the populace ensures that superstition runs rampant — the workforce fears and distrusts the tech-ghouls of the Mechanicus and lifeless, vacant stares of their Servitors, leading to immens",twelfmonkey,40kLore,Neutral,Gun Control,"Are Servitors mainly vat-grown, or made from living humans? What the lore actually says **TLDR: There is no basis to claim the majority of Servitors are vat-grown. The lore generally showcases that there are large proportions of both natural and vat-grown Servitors. The only explicit statement we have states a greater proportion are made from natural humans. I survey the relevant lore across the decades.**

A bit of a minor issue (which grew into a lengthy post), but I wanted to clarify something which is a surprisingly frequent topic of conversation – and which is inevitably accompanied by people making unsupported and incorrect claims.

Hopefully we are all aware of Servitors: the mind-wiped (though not always totally successfully…) cyborg automatons which are ubiquitous across most of the Imperium, undertaking a wide range of tasks.

But where do the bodies used to produce Servitors come from? Are they mainly vat-grown for the purpose? Or are the bodies and/or corpses of naturally-born people (which I will refer to as ‘organic’) the main source?

If you look at discussions about Servitors which appear on this sub and elsewhere, a lot of people claim – very confidently – that it is the former: that the majority (or, sometimes, it is even claimed, the vast majority) of Servitors are vat-grown. But there is not really any basis in the lore to support such a claim.

The clearest statement we have about the ratio of Servitors produced from vat-grown or once living people is:

>Most Servitors are manufactured by the Adeptus Mechanicus, either from genetically-engineered humanoid clones created for the purpose, **or more commonly from criminals sentenced to Servitude Imperpituis**, in which case their minds are wiped during processing.

>*Imperium Maledictum Core Rulebook* (2023), p. 322.

So, it is stated that the use of criminals is more common than vat-grown clones.

Most often, we are just told that there are a mix of vat-grown bodies and people being turned into Servitors, with no real info about the ratio – just a sense that both methods are common.

The most extensive account (well, that I have found anyway) is:

>Through ancient covenants with the Emperor himself, the adepts of the Cult Mechanicus have a monopoly on and jurisdiction over the use of all technology. To alter a machine’s prescribed operation or structure, to interfere with its inner workings without proper theological ministrations only a Tech Priest is privy to, are just some of the crimes for which the Adeptus Mechanicus is privileged to administer punishment. Lobotomised servitors – men and women who ran afoul of Tech Priests – are a  common sight throughout the Imperium. These unthinking creatures, heavily modified with bionic replacements, perform menial and repetitive tasks of every kind, and heir unhealthy pallor and slack jaws are a potent reminder of the dangers of crossing the Adeptus Mechanicus.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 11.

And:

>Raw Materials

>The careful and reverent reclamation of a fallen servitor’s mechanical components stands in sharp contrast to the ready destruction of its damaged flesh.

>…

>Whether servitors are expected to survive a day, a month, or longer, their creators know that there is an endless supply of replacement material to build another.

>The Creation Rites of Manifest Indenture lay down screed-covenants for the making of servitors, but they vary greatly not only from forge world to forge world, but from one temple to another and from one idiosyncratic Tech-Priest to the next. A number of servitors are built upon a base of vat-grown bodies of flesh and blood, typically Human but occasionally creatures of other lineages. These fully grown men and women are produced in large-scale batches on most forge worlds, matured in bubbling casks of artificial gene-gruel. The ready supply of naturally born Human from many other sources, however, means that few forge worlds every rely solely on growing such anthrostratum as some term it.

>Many other servitors were once criminals accused of any one of the Imperium’s byzantine and ruthlessly enforced laws 0 from low-born black marketeers, to outmanoeuvred members of the political elite, or Inquisitorial enforces who saw too much. Others are those who fall foul of the Cult Mecahnicus’ own oppressive codes against tech heresy. Some institutions or planets have longstanding agreements with forge words in their vicinity, handing over prisoners condemned under a wide variety of jurisdictions and for countless crimes. The Ecclesiarchy, the Adeptus Arbites, and planetary governors are just some of those who generate large numbers of soon-to-be servitors. Some of the freshly converted thralls return to those who judged them, serving both as unthinking slaves and visible warnings to others.

>Still other servitors were once people in the wrong place at the wrong time, taken, screaming, and remade to serve. Deserted frontier towns and emptied hab-blocks are frequent discoveries after one of a forge world’s Explorator fleets pass through a system. Few of those the Adeptus Mechanicus harvest are missed, and its political power means those who are will rarely be avenged. Tales also abound of people throwing themselves before a procession of Tech-Priests, begging to be reforged into a servitor. Some are religious zealots, either adherents to the Cult Mechanicus already or hoping to serve the Emperor in as ascetic or humble a manner as possible. Some instead seek escape from the misery and fear of Imperial life and believe that, once changed by the Tech-Priests, memory and pain will be blessedly erased.

>Whatever their origin, they are given a chance to provide the Imperium with a more useful servant. Each individual is mind-wiped, surgically and chemically lobotomised so that their memories are a blank slate – in theory at least., for there are harrowing tales of servitors retaining vestiges of consciousness without any means of communicating the horror of their new existence.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 23-24.

So, while vat-grown bodies are commonly used, a wide range of people are turned into Servitors too, whether due to being declared criminals (often likely spurious or unfair), due to reciprocal arrangements between other Imperial institutions and the Ad mech, or just the sheer bad luck of the Ad Mech scooping you up and then scooping out some of your brains.

We also get a sense of the various groups who utilize servitors, and those who are unfortunate to be turned into them, in a range of other sources:

>Multi-Task Servitor

>The Servitor is an essential part of Imperial life, a cybernetic construct entrusted with all manner of dangerous, repetitive, or menial tasks. **They are also a dire warning; many Servitors are vat-grown clones, but many are — or were — criminals, mind-wiped and sentenced to unending labour**. They can communicate verbally, but in a minimal fashion, as their higher brain functions are lost to augmetic replacements or stripped as punishment. Advanced models capable of serving as Familiars retain higher brain functions and perhaps the knowledge and skills they possessed before conversion. Any idiosyncrasies are merely ingrained nerve reflexes, or so the Tech-Priests claim.

>*Imperium Maledictum Inquisition Player’s Guide* (2024), p. 113.

And:

>In the grim darkness of the far future, there are many fates worse than death for a man. For those who believe in the sanctity of the body and soul, being mind-wiped and re-purposed as a servitor ranks high among them. Servitors are lobotomised, drooling automatons whose bodies have been augmented and outfitted for a single task. In the case of a Combat Servitor, this is to act as a mobile weapons platform. **While the human components of some Servitors are grown in vats, and others are the bodies of deserving criminals, that is not the extent of the horror of the universe most Imperial citizens live in. Vagrants, the downtrodden and the unlucky, all are candidates for Servitors.** Some well connected crime lords and tyrants turn those who have failed them into Servitors by way of punishment, others do it because they believe death does not represent the end of service. There are even records of Imperial Commanders making servitors from their mortally wounded warriors as some sort of twisted reward, allowing them to continue to fight in the Emperor’s name.

>*Wrath & Glory Core Rulebook* (2018), p. 411.

And:

>**While many servitors are adapted from artificially cultured drone bodies, others are the remains of humans who have committed some terrible crime.** The most severe punishment for a criminal in the Imperium is not death – that would be wasteful and hardly serve as a useful deterrent. Instead, the convicted are turned into servitors. The malefactor is first mind-wiped and then augmented and reprogrammed to perform some rudimentary function too tedious even for the menials of the Adeptus Administratum. Ex-convicts who become servitors wear a brass plate upon their body proclaiming their crime, as a warning to all who would transgress against the laws of the Emperor or the Omnissiah.

>Unlike the ignominious fate of criminals, the fate of those who die in honoured service to the Emperor is sometimes to be allowed to continue their labours in the form of a servo-skull.

>*Warhammer 40k Rulebook* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 280.

And, one which perhaps implies vat-grown may be more commonly used on Forgeworlds (due to the use of the word “supplemented”), but isn’t totally clear:

>The organic material used in the creation of these programmable slaves are sourced partly from growing vats on forge worlds, as well as supplemented from Imperial penitentiaries from across the galaxy.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 41.

And:

>THE MERCY OF THE OMNISSIAH

>The servitor complement of even a single forge world will typically number in the tens of millions. **Many were once wanted criminals – hard and intimidating men from all walks of Imperial life, from hive gangers stitched with vat-grown slabs of muscle to Inquisitorial enforcers that committed bloody murder after learning too much. When the Adeptus Arbites find a transgressor of surpassing physical size, that individual will be beaten senseless with power mauls and sent battered and bloody to the nearest forge world. There he is given a second chance to serve Mankind as one of its most faithful servants. First the specimen is mindwiped, chemically lobotomised so that his personality and memories are a blank slate – in theory at least**. Next his arms are cut away, usually replaced with weapons or tools suited to the new role his masters have chosen for him. In the case of battle servitors, the specimen will be halved at the abdomen and permanently sutured into a tracked motive unit. His mind will be hardwired with targeting computers, and his voice box surgically modified to better sing binharic praise to the Machine God. The process is of course painful in the extreme, but then no atonement is every truly complete without sacrifice.

>*Codex: Cult Mechanicus* 7^(th) ed. (2015), p. 48. (Also reprinted word-for word in the 8^(th) ed. Codex on page 46).

And:

>Servitor Drone

>**Ubiquitous throughout the Imperium, servitors are lobotomised cyborgs or vat-grown beings programmed to fulfil a variety of functions**. The most common are monotasked drones, slaved to perform simple tasks ranging from operating a noble’s autocarriage to scribing judicial proceedings. Some are so specialised that they are permanently hardwired in place, as in the case of lift-operators and pilot servitors

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 396.

And:

>Servitor

>**A servitor is an automaton whose controlling components are organic and mostly human in origin. Some are grown in vats, while others are formed from the aged bodies of honoured tech-priests or despised criminals whose punishment is to serve the Imperium in this fashion**. The process of creating a servitor purges higher brain functions and psychic pattern of the subject, rendering him a blank slate for reprogramming. The most common forms of servitor are mindless labour drones, dedicated to a small selection of simple tasks, and fitted with devices necessary to this toil. Some are not even mobile, being built into the machinery they control.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook* (2009), p. 146.

And:

>**Servitors are fusions of flesh and machine made from culture-grown organics, harvested corpses, or mindwiped human bodies**. Millions of these cyborg creations are found throughout the Imperium and human space, used to perform monotonous functions without deviation or question. Servitor technology is said to predate the Imperium itself and is the exclusive purview of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Servitors come in a seemingly endless variety of forms from baroque works of art designed to tend the needs of the rich and powerful, to crude, misshapen labour units fashioned for work in the most horrific industrial zones, to bellicose monsters of steel meant as near-mindless living weapons. The most common use of servitors is to perform mundane tasks such as waiting on nobles, routine maintenance, loading freight, sorting endless dockets, or tirelessly guarding a given locale.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook* (2009), p. 374.

And:

>Servitors are fusions of flesh and machine made from culture-grown organics, harvested corpses, or mind-wiped human bodies.

>*Only War Core Rulebook* (2012), p. 372.

And:

>Culturally, the Imperium is far more acclimatised to the idea of heavily cyberised systems that incorporate organic parts, with the trepanned crania of criminals and animals emptied for use as the control systems of heavy machinery, weapons, and vessels.

>Servitors — lobotomised, cyberised, and repurposed criminals or cultured organic organisms are ubiquitous across the entirety of human space, and most citizens of the Imperium hardly spare them a second glance.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 72.

And, going back to not long after they were first introduced:

>Many Servitors are adapted from artificially cultured drone bodies; others are mind-wiped humans who have committed some terrible crime.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 45.

We are also told this:

>The greater mass of Martians are worker-slaves called Servitors. Servitors are not really fully human, but half-man half-machine creatures whose minds have been partially programmed to perform specific duties.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 45.

And notion that Servitors constitute the bulk of the population of forge worlds more generally has appeared in earlier quotes, but is also stated here too:

>The overwhelming majority of any forge world's population are made up of servitors, ranging in form and function from monotask mining cyborgs and holomats (holographic recording units), to Gun Servitors and armoured Praetorians.

>*Dark Heresy: The Lathe Worlds* (2012), p. 11.

And:

>The servitor complement of even a single forge world typically numbers in the tens, or even hundreds of millions, outnumbering Skitarii and Tech-Priests many times over. Especially ancient or powerful forge worlds, such as Mars itself, are supported by several times that number.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 24.

I have seen people argue that this means that most Servitors must be vat-grown, otherwise how could there be so many of them on forge worlds? Well, given everything we are told about how many people are designated for servitorization by various institutions or how willing the Ad Mech are to just nab whole communities, there are reasons provided to help explain this (whether someone personally buys into them is another matter, of course). And powerful forgeworlds like Mars will be having far more deals with other planets and institutions, and far more resources fed into them.

We also get some more specific details about different imperial organizations acquire and make use of Servitors. Starting with Space Marines, the 2^(nd) edition *Codex: Ultramarines* (which kind of served as the Codex for all ‘vanilla’ Chapters at the time) reprinted this from *Codex Imperialis*:

>Servitors are created by the Techmarines as assistants and servants. They are weird combinations of men and machines, bio-engineered by the Techmarines to perform specific tasks. **Their bodies are grown from human gene-cells in vats of artificial nutrient**, and although physically strong and robust their minds are blank and incapable of development or of feeling much pain. Techmarines insert bio-programs into their Servitors’ brains, and replace parts of their bodies with mechanical contrivances such as huge metal claws, infra-red sensors for eyes, or whatever other specialised tools are required.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 22; *Codex: Ultramarines* 2^(nd) ed. (1995), p. 50.

Which, does suggest that all Servitors used by Space Marine Chapters were, at that point in the lore, grown for purpose. Of course, contradictions abound in 40k lore, so later we get:

>**The creation mysteries for Servitors vary from Chapter to Chapter. Some are grown from human gene-cells in artificial nutrient. Others are failed neophytes, civilian criminals or fugitives from Chapter law who have been mind-wiped and lobotomised so that their flesh may serve anew**.

>…

>Though essential to the maintenance of a Chapter's mechanical devices, Servitors rarely enjoy anything save indifference from the Space Marines they serve. In most Chapters, the Servitors are ignored by all but the Techmarines, treated as would any other machine or piece of equipment. In others they are treated with revulsion, considered necessary but abhorrences that pervert the spirit and the flesh of man. Conversely, in a very few Space Marine Chapters, generally those with strong ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus, Servitors are regarded as having achieved spiritual union with the Omnissiah. In such Chapters, Servitors are biomechanoid shrines, revered almost as greatly as other artefacts, their words sifted and analysed for hints of prophecy and guidance from the Machine God. Those Space Marines who follow these arcane practices believe that in so doing they are brought closer to the Omnissiah. To other Chapters, such behaviour is thought distasteful to the point of heresy and regarded with hostility and suspicion. What the Servitors think of all this - if indeed they even notice - no one knows.

>*Codex: Space Marines 5th ed.* (2008), p. 72.

And:

>A servitor is an automaton whose controlling components are organic and mostly human in origin. Some are grown in vats, while others are formed from failed recruits or civilian criminals whose sentence is an un-life of service to the Imperium’s heroes. The process of creating a servitor purges higher brain functions and psychic patterns of the subject, rendering him a blank slate for reprogramming.

>*Deathwatch Core Rulebook* (2010), p. 172.

So, again, a mix between vat-grown and more ‘organic’ sources.

As regards the Ad Mech and forgeworlds, we get told:

>A forge world’s undisputed masters are the Magi of the Cult Mechanicus, who rule with harsh precision and cold logic. To them, the human menials of their domains are little more than cogs and gears in the great machine, resources to be measured, graded, and used to fit their worth. At their direction, the bulk of a forge world’s population is utilised as a skilled and trained labour force, whilst the brightest and best are inducted to the Adeptus Mechanicus itself. The more militant are chosen for the Skitarii Tech-guard. **Those deemed unworthy or irredeemable are fated to be “recycled” into servitor components, and indeed, servitors and drones often far outnumber a forge world’s free-willed population. Such is the price of failure**.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook*, p. 19.

This notion of those deemed unworthy being servitorised is reiterated elsewhere, as is the idea that those who break rules regarding technology and knowledge are also turned into Servitors:

>A forge world Homeworld Origin is a great starting point for any Acolyte who wishes to begin his career in the dank, cramped, and polluted worlds of the Lathes. Life within a forge world is exceptionally difficult, and only the hardy and strong survive. Those who show any signs of weakness are cast out, or worse, repurposed into mindless Servitors, forever destined to a menial existence of endless repetition.

>*Dark Heresy: Lathe Worlds, Lost Dataslate* (2012), p. 4.

And:

>SERVITORS

>Those without the capacity for knowledge and those who betray the secrets entrusted to them by the Tech-Priests are re-purposed into living machines by the Cult Mechanicus.

>*Dark Heresy: The Lathe Worlds* (2012), p. 11.

We also have an interesting note about one specific type of Servitor used by the Ad Mech, in form of Kataphron Breachers:

>Many of the fleshy components of servitors are vat-grown, but it was soon discovered that these artificial organics were unable to bond properly with the hulking machinery of the Kataphron Breacher. After some experimentation, it was found that the constructs only work properly when centred around the soul of what was not just a living man, but a particularly violent one.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 46.

And we told this about the attitude of Ad Mech staff on many space ships:

>Crew Reclamation Facility

>The Mechanicus has no qualms about converting the grievously wounded into servitors...but the rest of the crew may differ in opinion.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook*, p. 205.

If we turn to how servitorisation is used as a punishment for crimes, we can look at the role of the Adeptus Arbites. A general overview notes:

>In practice, the Arbitrators are tasked to punish criminal activity, root out cultists and illegal gatherings, eliminate organised gangs, and are often unleashed en mass to quell riots. They must be as willing to dispense justice as they are to pronounce it. Often the punishment will be a swift bullet to the brain (or the perpetrator will have expired during the process of apprehension and interrogation). **Other sentences, amongst the hundreds of thousands available, include flogging, limb amputation, exile to a prison world, condemnation to a penal legion, public execution, or conversion into a servitor**.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 8.

Looking more specifically at the situation in the Askellon Sector, after it being explained that rehabilitation for criminals is exceptionally rare, we are told:

>“Less rarely, a subject serves the God-Emperor in other ways, as servitor candidates or service within the Penal Legions of Kommitzar are always a viable punishment.”

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 42.

And we are told local Enforcers also use servitorisation as a punishment:

>It is the scavenger gangs who build the majority of criminal gear within the Calixis Sector: small gangs, acting alone, attempting to grab power or wealth for themselves. As they are more an underworld society than a unified criminal whole, the Adeptus Arbites spend vast resources to monitor these minor cells to prevent them from endangering the status quo. **While the arrest and punishment (often execution or service as a servitor) is left primarily to the planetary Enforcers**, it is not completely unheard of for an Arbitrator to find reason to apprehend a gang leader for his own purposes.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 78.

Next we can look at the fate of psykers who are taken by the Black Ships:

Many psykers die en route to Terra, but those who survive are rigorously tested to work out their best use. Upon reaching the Imperial home world, the psykers are sorted, graded and assigned to various duties. The vast majority are sent to the Astronomican to serve the great beacon – their lives are short, painful and culminate in an agonising death. **A goodly number are deemed too unstable even for that duty. Most of these are lobotomised, becoming mindless servitors**, but a few are spirited away to the Obsidian Keep in the heart of the Astra Telepathica palace complex where an unknown fate awaits them.

*Warhammer 40k Rulebook* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 39.

And the Ecclesiarchy also of course gets in on the action too:

>Automatons of the Holy Ordos are often made from human components and come in a variety of forms. However, they almost all have one thing in common – they were created using heretics as the basis. The Ministorum takes great delight in stripping heretics of their former personalities and will, and reprogramming them to have undying loyalty to the God-Emperor they once foreswore. An even better treat is to send these same heretics into battle to assist in eliminating other heretics and their corrupting ways.

>Arco-Flagellant.

>For those heretics found guilty of heresies insufficient severity to warrant immediate execution, there is another fate in store: arco-flagellation.

>*Dark Heresy: Blood of Martyrs* (2010), p. 122.

It’s not just the authorities who can turn people into Servitors either, as some gangs do so too:

>Tech Gangs

>Some gangs include actual servitors, mostly captured in upper-hive raids. A few create their own from lobotomised members with implanted and experimental augmentations. These rarely live long.

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 337.

And if we look at specific examples of Servitors being created and the materials used to do so across the lore, we see a mix of both vat-grown and ‘organic’ examples – with plenty, and likely more, of the latter.

We have the example of an Ad Mech group in Varangantua on the world of Alecto turining criminals into Servitors (and dabbling in some criminality and tech heresyw hile doing so…). More info on this and plenty of relevant quotes here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/13j2k97/excerpt\_flesh\_and\_steel\_the\_business\_and\_body/](https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/13j2k97/excerpt_flesh_and_steel_the_business_and_body/)

For our purposes, a key passage is:

>Naked human beings were standing in a switchbacked line between high fences. Outside the fences Adeptus Mechanicus menials in environment suits stood guard with shock goads in hand. The people, all mature men and women, were shepherded down the caged walk like livestock. And they were food beasts being led to the slaughter, meat for the ravenous appetite of the Machine-God.

>…

>The manufactorum produced servitors, but it was more akin to an abattoir than a workshop. Every surface was easily cleanable. Large plastek flaps divided areas from each other. Servitors with spray units surgically attached to their backs prowled about, hosing filth into slit drains set into the perfectly smooth, slanted floors. We walked above all this, past sentry pods on spikes occupied by galvanic rifle-armed snipers. Our path went from one end of the hall to the other, and I could see pretty much the whole sorting process, beginning to end.

>As the line slowly advanced, the people were passed through various scanning devices, most of them mounted in ugly, functional arches that let out a constant series of acceptance chimes. Occasionally, one would let out an angry blare, and the indicator lumens would flash red. The rejected person was then swallowed up by a trapdoor opening beneath their feet. From these pits wafted a hideous stench, and the grinding sounds of industrial mincers. One rejected man grabbed on to the lip and hung there, arms and hands bloodied, shouting a stream of defiant profanities. Guards lined the grating either side of him and shocked him until he fell. The adepts wouldn’t even waste bullets on these people.

>The trapdoor flipped up, and the next terrified person was ushered forward.

>A number of pneumatic gates separated the people from each part of the process, snapping open and shut with bone-crushing force.

>Violent metal arms snatched them up and spread-eagled them in the air, and a servitor shearer shaved them all over. At another they were subjected to a high-pressure counterseptic wash whose chemical stink made me choke from a hundred feet away. More scanners, more rejects winnowed out. Machines forcibly dressed them in the heavy rubberised garments common to all mono-tasked servitors. These were saggy on them, all one size, until another process force-shrank them to fit their bodies where metal cuffs, sockets and collars bit into vulnerable flesh. The last few prayers gave way to screams at that point, and even the most stoic shouted in pain. They were ushered over a floor buzzing with power that made them shriek with every footstep.

An example of a deal to ship people into a forgeworld in return for resources:

>Throughout the Age of Imperium, Cerix Magnus has led the forge worlds of Askellon, entering into a number of reciprocal arrangements with other factions including several nearby Knight worlds. In return for the supply of weapons and other advanced materiel they manufacture, the numerous other worlds serve what needs it cannot meet itself. These range from raw natural resources vital to manufacturing, to Knights and other forces in times of armed conflict\*\*, to a supply of sinners to be converted into the many servitors each forge relies upon for its many tasks.\*\*

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 341.

And bounty hunters playing a role in the servitor production system:

>Desoleum Bounty Hunter

>In Hive Desoleum, bounty hunters do not hunt men—for a man is inconsequential and easily replaced. Rather, they hunt oaths. Fundamentally, the commission of a crime is a violation of a citizen’s oath to hive and master. Should a citizen compound his offence by fleeing justice, he takes with him his yet-unfulfilled oath. **It is the job of oath hunters to track and return them to complete their service— possibly as a servitor**.

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 384.

There was a deal between the Ecclesiarchy and Ad Mech to deal with overcrowding:

>As burial space on Granithor became precious due to crowding, the Ecclesiarchy looked to the moon as a means of dealing with ""lesser"" burials. At first, they began to ""dump"" unworthy aspirants, living as well as dead, on Donaris without ceremony or permission. Magos Artitaeus registered a formal complaint with the Sector Governor and the two sides met at the Scrobis Accords. Archbishop Sophatus, who represented the Ecclesiarchy at the Accords, was surprised that the Mechanicus not only accepted the situation, but insisted on including a clause requiring that all postulants turned away from Granithor be sent to Donaris and agreed that the dead should be placed in crypts that they would construct. They also stipulated an Ecclesiarchal enclave be created on the moon to monitor the Mechanicus' end of the arrangement, something that the Ministorum has subsequently come to view as a slap in the face. Leadership of the enclave has never been a popular position and is widely regarded as a mild punishment for past misdeeds.

>**The Mechanicus constructed the crypts as promised, but any living persons accompanying the dead — pall bearers and others of funeral parties — were evaluated for servitor production, and those found suitable... The Ecclesiarchy chafes under the concept that some members of their flock now fill the lowest ranks of the Omnissiah's congregation**, but the sheer volume of supplicants wishing to be buried on Granithor leaves them little choice but to accept the Accord's ""solution.""

>**The Mechanicus have steadily increased the size and scope of their facilities on Donaris ever since; and it is now one of the largest servitor production facilities outside of the Lathes**.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 118.

There is an example of the Adminstratum allowing the Ad Mech to turn farmers into Servitors to increase efficiency:

>Even the augmented forms of the Adeptus Mechanicus need sustenance, and after hearing of potential issues with harvests on Ostia, the Machine Cults of Avachrus engaged their cogitators and calculated a way to benefit. The Administratum gladly accepted the aid of their farming Servitors, even allowing them to convert the simple farmers into far more efficient lobotomised labourers, allowing the Adeptus Mechanicus to contest the power of the Ecclesiarchy on Ostia for the first time. But the earnest faith of the populace ensures that superstition runs rampant — the workforce fears and distrusts the tech-gh","are servitors mainly vat-grown , or made from living humans ? what the lore actually says * * tldr : there is no basis to claim the majority of servitors are vat-grown . the lore generally showcases that there are large proportions of both natural and vat-grown servitors . the only explicit statement we have states a greater proportion are made from natural humans . i survey the relevant lore across the decades . * * a bit of a minor ( which grew into a post ) , but i wanted to clarify something which is a surprisingly frequent topic of conversation – and which is accompanied by people making and claims . hopefully we are all aware of servitors : the mind-wiped ( though not always totally successfully… ) cyborg automatons which are ubiquitous across most of the imperium , undertaking a wide range of tasks . but where do the bodies used to produce servitors come from ? are they mainly vat-grown for the purpose ? or are the bodies and/or corpses of naturally-born people ( which i will refer to as ‘ organic ’ ) the main source ? if you look at discussions about servitors which appear on this sub and elsewhere , a lot of people claim – very confidently – that it is the former : that the majority ( or , sometimes , it is even claimed , the vast majority ) of servitors are vat-grown . but there is not really any basis in the lore to such a claim . the clearest statement we have about the ratio of servitors produced from vat-grown or once living people is : > most servitors are manufactured by the adeptus mechanicus , either from genetically-engineered humanoid clones created for the purpose , * * or more commonly from criminals sentenced to imperpituis * * , in which case their minds are wiped during processing . > * imperium maledictum core rulebook * ( 2023 ) , p. 322. so , it is stated that the use of criminals is more common than vat-grown clones . most often , we are just told that there are a mix of vat-grown bodies and people being turned into servitors , with no real info about the ratio – just a sense that both methods are common . the most extensive account ( , that i have found anyway ) is : > through ancient covenants with the emperor himself , the adepts of the cult mechanicus have a monopoly on and jurisdiction over the use of all technology . to alter a machine ’ s prescribed operation or structure , to with its inner workings without theological ministrations only a tech priest is privy to , are just some of the crimes for which the adeptus mechanicus is to administer punishment . lobotomised servitors – men and women who ran afoul of tech priests – are a common sight throughout the imperium . these unthinking creatures , heavily modified with bionic replacements , perform and tasks of every kind , and heir pallor and jaws are a potent reminder of the dangers of crossing the adeptus mechanicus . > * codex : adeptus mechanicus * 10^ ( th ) ed .

What the lore actually says **TLDR: There is no basis to claim the majority of Servitors are vat-grown. The lore generally showcases that there are large proportions of both natural and vat-grown Servitors. The only explicit statement we have states a greater proportion are made from natural humans. I survey the relevant lore across the decades.**

A bit of a minor issue (which grew into a lengthy post), but I wanted to clarify something which is a surprisingly frequent topic of conversation – and which is inevitably accompanied by people making unsupported and incorrect claims.

Hopefully we are all aware of Servitors: the mind-wiped (though not always totally successfully…) cyborg automatons which are ubiquitous across most of the Imperium, undertaking a wide range of tasks.

But where do the bodies used to produce Servitors come from? Are they mainly vat-grown for the purpose? Or are the bodies and/or corpses of naturally-born people (which I will refer to as ‘organic’) the main source?

If you look at discussions about Servitors which appear on this sub and elsewhere, a lot of people claim – very confidently – that it is the former: that the majority (or, sometimes, it is even claimed, the vast majority) of Servitors are vat-grown. But there is not really any basis in the lore to support such a claim.

The clearest statement we have about the ratio of Servitors produced from vat-grown or once living people is:

>Most Servitors are manufactured by the Adeptus Mechanicus, either from genetically-engineered humanoid clones created for the purpose, **or more commonly from criminals sentenced to Servitude Imperpituis**, in which case their minds are wiped during processing.

>*Imperium Maledictum Core Rulebook* (2023), p. 322.

So, it is stated that the use of criminals is more common than vat-grown clones.

Most often, we are just told that there are a mix of vat-grown bodies and people being turned into Servitors, with no real info about the ratio – just a sense that both methods are common.

The most extensive account (well, that I have found anyway) is:

>Through ancient covenants with the Emperor himself, the adepts of the Cult Mechanicus have a monopoly on and jurisdiction over the use of all technology. To alter a machine’s prescribed operation or structure, to interfere with its inner workings without proper theological ministrations only a Tech Priest is privy to, are just some of the crimes for which the Adeptus Mechanicus is privileged to administer punishment. Lobotomised servitors – men and women who ran afoul of Tech Priests – are a  common sight throughout the Imperium. These unthinking creatures, heavily modified with bionic replacements, perform menial and repetitive tasks of every kind, and heir unhealthy pallor and slack jaws are a potent reminder of the dangers of crossing the Adeptus Mechanicus.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 11.

And:

>Raw Materials

>The careful and reverent reclamation of a fallen servitor’s mechanical components stands in sharp contrast to the ready destruction of its damaged flesh.

>…

>Whether servitors are expected to survive a day, a month, or longer, their creators know that there is an endless supply of replacement material to build another.

>The Creation Rites of Manifest Indenture lay down screed-covenants for the making of servitors, but they vary greatly not only from forge world to forge world, but from one temple to another and from one idiosyncratic Tech-Priest to the next. A number of servitors are built upon a base of vat-grown bodies of flesh and blood, typically Human but occasionally creatures of other lineages. These fully grown men and women are produced in large-scale batches on most forge worlds, matured in bubbling casks of artificial gene-gruel. The ready supply of naturally born Human from many other sources, however, means that few forge worlds every rely solely on growing such anthrostratum as some term it.

>Many other servitors were once criminals accused of any one of the Imperium’s byzantine and ruthlessly enforced laws 0 from low-born black marketeers, to outmanoeuvred members of the political elite, or Inquisitorial enforces who  too much. Others are those who fall foul of the Cult Mecahnicus’ own oppressive codes against tech heresy. Some institutions or planets have longstanding agreements with forge words in their vicinity, handing over prisoners condemned under a wide variety of jurisdictions and for countless crimes. The Ecclesiarchy, the Adeptus Arbites, and planetary governors are just some of those who generate large numbers of soon-to-be servitors. Some of the freshly converted thralls return to those who judged them, serving both as unthinking slaves and visible warnings to others.

>Still other servitors were once people in the wrong place at the wrong time, taken, screaming, and remade to serve. Deserted frontier towns and emptied hab-blocks are frequent discoveries after one of a forge world’s Explorator fleets pass through a system. Few of those the Adeptus Mechanicus harvest are missed, and its political power means those who are will rarely be avenged. Tales also abound of people throwing themselves before a procession of Tech-Priests, begging to be reforged into a servitor. Some are religious zealots, either adherents to the Cult Mechanicus already or hoping to serve the Emperor in as ascetic or humble a manner as possible. Some instead seek escape from the misery and fear of Imperial life and believe that, once changed by the Tech-Priests, memory and pain will be blessedly erased.

>Whatever their origin, they are given a chance to provide the Imperium with a more useful servant. Each individual is mind-wiped, surgically and chemically lobotomised so that their memories are a blank slate – in theory at least., for there are harrowing tales of servitors retaining vestiges of consciousness without any means of communicating the horror of their new existence.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 23-24.

So, while vat-grown bodies are commonly used, a wide range of people are turned into Servitors too, whether due to being declared criminals (often likely spurious or unfair), due to reciprocal arrangements between other Imperial institutions and the Ad mech, or just the sheer bad luck of the Ad Mech scooping you up and then scooping out some of your brains.

We also get a sense of the various groups who utilize servitors, and those who are unfortunate to be turned into them, in a range of other sources:

>Multi-Task Servitor

>The Servitor is an essential part of Imperial life, a cybernetic construct entrusted with all manner of dangerous, repetitive, or menial tasks. **They are also a dire warning; many Servitors are vat-grown clones, but many are — or were — criminals, mind-wiped and sentenced to unending labour**. They can communicate verbally, but in a minimal fashion, as their higher brain functions are lost to augmetic replacements or stripped as punishment. Advanced models capable of serving as Familiars retain higher brain functions and perhaps the knowledge and skills they possessed before conversion. Any idiosyncrasies are merely ingrained nerve reflexes, or so the Tech-Priests claim.

>*Imperium Maledictum Inquisition Player’s Guide* (2024), p. 113.

And:

>In the grim darkness of the far future, there are many fates worse than death for a man. For those who believe in the sanctity of the body and soul, being mind-wiped and re-purposed as a servitor ranks high among them. Servitors are lobotomised, drooling automatons whose bodies have been augmented and outfitted for a single task. In the case of a Combat Servitor, this is to act as a mobile weapons platform. **While the human components of some Servitors are grown in vats, and others are the bodies of deserving criminals, that is not the extent of the horror of the universe most Imperial citizens live in. Vagrants, the downtrodden and the unlucky, all are candidates for Servitors.** Some well connected crime lords and tyrants turn those who have failed them into Servitors by way of punishment, others do it because they believe death does not represent the end of service. There are even records of Imperial Commanders making servitors from their mortally wounded warriors as some sort of twisted reward, allowing them to continue to fight in the Emperor’s name.

>*Wrath & Glory Core Rulebook* (2018), p. 411.

And:

>**While many servitors are adapted from artificially cultured drone bodies, others are the remains of humans who have committed some terrible crime.** The most severe punishment for a criminal in the Imperium is not death – that would be wasteful and hardly serve as a useful deterrent. Instead, the convicted are turned into servitors. The malefactor is first mind-wiped and then augmented and reprogrammed to perform some rudimentary function too tedious even for the menials of the Adeptus Administratum. Ex-convicts who become servitors wear a brass plate upon their body proclaiming their crime, as a warning to all who would transgress against the laws of the Emperor or the Omnissiah.

>Unlike the ignominious fate of criminals, the fate of those who die in honoured service to the Emperor is sometimes to be allowed to continue their labours in the form of a servo-skull.

>*Warhammer 40k Rulebook* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 280.

And, one which perhaps implies vat-grown may be more commonly used on Forgeworlds (due to the use of the word “supplemented”), but isn’t totally clear:

>The organic material used in the creation of these programmable slaves are sourced partly from growing vats on forge worlds, as well as supplemented from Imperial penitentiaries from across the galaxy.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 41.

And:

>THE MERCY OF THE OMNISSIAH

>The servitor complement of even a single forge world will typically number in the tens of millions. **Many were once wanted criminals – hard and intimidating men from all walks of Imperial life, from hive gangers stitched with vat-grown slabs of muscle to Inquisitorial enforcers that committed bloody murder after learning too much. When the Adeptus Arbites find a transgressor of surpassing physical size, that individual will be beaten senseless with power mauls and sent battered and bloody to the nearest forge world. There he is given a second chance to serve Mankind as one of its most faithful servants. First the specimen is mindwiped, chemically lobotomised so that his personality and memories are a blank slate – in theory at least**. Next his arms are cut away, usually replaced with weapons or tools suited to the new role his masters have chosen for him. In the case of battle servitors, the specimen will be halved at the abdomen and permanently sutured into a tracked motive unit. His mind will be hardwired with targeting computers, and his voice box surgically modified to better sing binharic praise to the Machine God. The process is of course painful in the extreme, but then no atonement is every truly complete without sacrifice.

>*Codex: Cult Mechanicus* 7^(th) ed. (2015), p. 48. (Also reprinted word-for word in the 8^(th) ed. Codex on page 46).

And:

>Servitor Drone

>**Ubiquitous throughout the Imperium, servitors are lobotomised cyborgs or vat-grown beings programmed to fulfil a variety of functions**. The most common are monotasked drones, slaved to perform simple tasks ranging from operating a noble’s autocarriage to scribing judicial proceedings. Some are so specialised that they are permanently hardwired in place, as in the case of lift-operators and pilot servitors

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 396.

And:

>Servitor

>**A servitor is an automaton whose controlling components are organic and mostly human in origin. Some are grown in vats, while others are formed from the aged bodies of honoured tech-priests or despised criminals whose punishment is to serve the Imperium in this fashion**. The process of creating a servitor purges higher brain functions and psychic pattern of the subject, rendering him a blank slate for reprogramming. The most common forms of servitor are mindless labour drones, dedicated to a small selection of simple tasks, and fitted with devices necessary to this toil. Some are not even mobile, being built into the machinery they control.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook* (2009), p. 146.

And:

>**Servitors are fusions of flesh and machine made from culture-grown organics, harvested corpses, or mindwiped human bodies**. Millions of these cyborg creations are found throughout the Imperium and human space, used to perform monotonous functions without deviation or question. Servitor technology is said to predate the Imperium itself and is the exclusive purview of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Servitors come in a seemingly endless variety of forms from baroque works of art designed to tend the needs of the rich and powerful, to crude, misshapen labour units fashioned for work in the most horrific industrial zones, to bellicose monsters of steel meant as near-mindless living weapons. The most common use of servitors is to perform mundane tasks such as waiting on nobles, routine maintenance, loading freight, sorting endless dockets, or tirelessly guarding a given locale.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook* (2009), p. 374.

And:

>Servitors are fusions of flesh and machine made from culture-grown organics, harvested corpses, or mind-wiped human bodies.

>*Only War Core Rulebook* (2012), p. 372.

And:

>Culturally, the Imperium is far more acclimatised to the idea of heavily cyberised systems that incorporate organic parts, with the trepanned crania of criminals and animals emptied for use as the control systems of heavy machinery, weapons, and vessels.

>Servitors — lobotomised, cyberised, and repurposed criminals or cultured organic organisms are ubiquitous across the entirety of human space, and most citizens of the Imperium hardly spare them a second glance.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 72.

And, going back to not long after they were first introduced:

>Many Servitors are adapted from artificially cultured drone bodies; others are mind-wiped humans who have committed some terrible crime.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 45.

We are also told this:

>The greater mass of Martians are worker-slaves called Servitors. Servitors are not really fully human, but half-man half-machine creatures whose minds have been partially programmed to perform specific duties.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 45.

And notion that Servitors constitute the bulk of the population of forge worlds more generally has appeared in earlier quotes, but is also stated here too:

>The overwhelming majority of any forge world's population are made up of servitors, ranging in form and function from monotask mining cyborgs and holomats (holographic recording units), to Gun Servitors and armoured Praetorians.

>*Dark Heresy: The Lathe Worlds* (2012), p. 11.

And:

>The servitor complement of even a single forge world typically numbers in the tens, or even hundreds of millions, outnumbering Skitarii and Tech-Priests many times over. Especially ancient or powerful forge worlds, such as Mars itself, are supported by several times that number.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 10^(th) ed. (2023), p. 24.

I have seen people argue that this means that most Servitors must be vat-grown, otherwise how could there be so many of them on forge worlds? Well, given everything we are told about how many people are designated for servitorization by various institutions or how willing the Ad Mech are to just nab whole communities, there are reasons provided to help explain this (whether someone personally buys into them is another matter, of course). And powerful forgeworlds like Mars will be having far more deals with other planets and institutions, and far more resources fed into them.

We also get some more specific details about different imperial organizations acquire and make use of Servitors. Starting with Space Marines, the 2^(nd) edition *Codex: Ultramarines* (which kind of served as the Codex for all ‘vanilla’ Chapters at the time) reprinted this from *Codex Imperialis*:

>Servitors are created by the Techmarines as assistants and servants. They are weird combinations of men and machines, bio-engineered by the Techmarines to perform specific tasks. **Their bodies are grown from human gene-cells in vats of artificial nutrient**, and although physically strong and robust their minds are blank and incapable of development or of feeling much pain. Techmarines insert bio-programs into their Servitors’ brains, and replace parts of their bodies with mechanical contrivances such as huge metal claws, infra-red sensors for eyes, or whatever other specialised tools are required.

>*Codex Imperialis* (1993), p. 22; *Codex: Ultramarines* 2^(nd) ed. (1995), p. 50.

Which, does suggest that all Servitors used by Space Marine Chapters were, at that point in the lore, grown for purpose. Of course, contradictions abound in 40k lore, so later we get:

>**The creation mysteries for Servitors vary from Chapter to Chapter. Some are grown from human gene-cells in artificial nutrient. Others are failed neophytes, civilian criminals or fugitives from Chapter law who have been mind-wiped and lobotomised so that their flesh may serve anew**.

>…

>Though essential to the maintenance of a Chapter's mechanical devices, Servitors rarely enjoy anything save indifference from the Space Marines they serve. In most Chapters, the Servitors are ignored by all but the Techmarines, treated as would any other machine or piece of equipment. In others they are treated with revulsion, considered necessary but abhorrences that pervert the spirit and the flesh of man. Conversely, in a very few Space Marine Chapters, generally those with strong ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus, Servitors are regarded as having achieved spiritual union with the Omnissiah. In such Chapters, Servitors are biomechanoid shrines, revered almost as greatly as other artefacts, their words sifted and analysed for hints of prophecy and guidance from the Machine God. Those Space Marines who follow these arcane practices believe that in so doing they are brought closer to the Omnissiah. To other Chapters, such behaviour is thought distasteful to the point of heresy and regarded with hostility and suspicion. What the Servitors think of all this - if indeed they even notice - no one knows.

>*Codex: Space Marines 5th ed.* (2008), p. 72.

And:

>A servitor is an automaton whose controlling components are organic and mostly human in origin. Some are grown in vats, while others are formed from failed recruits or civilian criminals whose sentence is an un-life of service to the Imperium’s heroes. The process of creating a servitor purges higher brain functions and psychic patterns of the subject, rendering him a blank slate for reprogramming.

>*Deathwatch Core Rulebook* (2010), p. 172.

So, again, a mix between vat-grown and more ‘organic’ sources.

As regards the Ad Mech and forgeworlds, we get told:

>A forge world’s undisputed masters are the Magi of the Cult Mechanicus, who rule with harsh precision and cold logic. To them, the human menials of their domains are little more than cogs and gears in the great machine, resources to be measured, graded, and used to fit their worth. At their direction, the bulk of a forge world’s population is utilised as a skilled and trained labour force, whilst the brightest and best are inducted to the Adeptus Mechanicus itself. The more militant are chosen for the Skitarii Tech-guard. **Those deemed unworthy or irredeemable are fated to be “recycled” into servitor components, and indeed, servitors and drones often far outnumber a forge world’s -willed population. Such is the price of failure**.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook*, p. 19.

This notion of those deemed unworthy being servitorised is reiterated elsewhere, as is the idea that those who break rules regarding technology and knowledge are also turned into Servitors:

>A forge world Homeworld Origin is a great starting point for any Acolyte who wishes to begin his career in the dank, cramped, and polluted worlds of the Lathes. Life within a forge world is exceptionally difficult, and only the hardy and strong survive. Those who show any signs of weakness are cast out, or worse, repurposed into mindless Servitors, forever destined to a menial existence of endless repetition.

>*Dark Heresy: Lathe Worlds, Lost Dataslate* (2012), p. 4.

And:

>SERVITORS

>Those without the capacity for knowledge and those who betray the secrets entrusted to them by the Tech-Priests are re-purposed into living machines by the Cult Mechanicus.

>*Dark Heresy: The Lathe Worlds* (2012), p. 11.

We also have an interesting note about one specific type of Servitor used by the Ad Mech, in form of Kataphron Breachers:

>Many of the fleshy components of servitors are vat-grown, but it was soon discovered that these artificial organics were unable to bond properly with the hulking machinery of the Kataphron Breacher. After some experimentation, it was found that the constructs only work properly when centred around the soul of what was not just a living man, but a particularly violent one.

>*Codex: Adeptus Mechanicus* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 46.

And we told this about the attitude of Ad Mech staff on many space ships:

>Crew Reclamation Facility

>The Mechanicus has no qualms about converting the grievously wounded into servitors...but the rest of the crew may differ in opinion.

>*Rogue Trader RPG Core Rulebook*, p. 205.

If we turn to how servitorisation is used as a punishment for crimes, we can look at the role of the Adeptus Arbites. A general overview notes:

>In practice, the Arbitrators are tasked to punish criminal activity, root out cultists and illegal gatherings, eliminate organised gangs, and are often unleashed en mass to quell riots. They must be as willing to dispense justice as they are to pronounce it. Often the punishment will be a swift bullet to the brain (or the perpetrator will have expired during the process of apprehension and interrogation). **Other sentences, amongst the hundreds of thousands available, include flogging, limb amputation, exile to a prison world, condemnation to a penal legion, public execution, or conversion into a servitor**.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 8.

Looking more specifically at the situation in the Askellon Sector, after it being explained that rehabilitation for criminals is exceptionally rare, we are told:

>“Less rarely, a subject serves the God-Emperor in other ways, as servitor candidates or service within the Penal Legions of Kommitzar are always a viable punishment.”

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 42.

And we are told local Enforcers also use servitorisation as a punishment:

>It is the scavenger gangs who build the majority of criminal gear within the Calixis Sector: small gangs, acting alone, attempting to grab power or wealth for themselves. As they are more an underworld society than a unified criminal whole, the Adeptus Arbites spend vast resources to monitor these minor cells to prevent them from endangering the status quo. **While the arrest and punishment (often execution or service as a servitor) is left primarily to the planetary Enforcers**, it is not completely unheard of for an Arbitrator to find reason to apprehend a gang leader for his own purposes.

>*Dark Heresy: Book of Judgement* (2011), p. 78.

Next we can look at the fate of psykers who are taken by the Black Ships:

Many psykers die en route to Terra, but those who survive are rigorously tested to work out their best use. Upon reaching the Imperial home world, the psykers are sorted, graded and assigned to various duties. The vast majority are sent to the Astronomican to serve the great beacon – their lives are short, painful and culminate in an agonising death. **A goodly number are deemed too unstable even for that duty. Most of these are lobotomised, becoming mindless servitors**, but a few are spirited away to the Obsidian Keep in the heart of the Astra Telepathica palace complex where an unknown fate awaits them.

*Warhammer 40k Rulebook* 8^(th) ed. (2017), p. 39.

And the Ecclesiarchy also of course gets in on the action too:

>Automatons of the Holy Ordos are often made from human components and come in a variety of forms. However, they almost all have one thing in common – they were created using heretics as the basis. The Ministorum takes great delight in stripping heretics of their former personalities and will, and reprogramming them to have undying loyalty to the God-Emperor they once foreswore. An even better treat is to send these same heretics into battle to assist in eliminating other heretics and their corrupting ways.

>Arco-Flagellant.

>For those heretics found guilty of heresies insufficient severity to warrant immediate execution, there is another fate in store: arco-flagellation.

>*Dark Heresy: Blood of Martyrs* (2010), p. 122.

It’s not just the authorities who can turn people into Servitors either, as some gangs do so too:

>Tech Gangs

>Some gangs include actual servitors, mostly captured in upper-hive raids. A few create their own from lobotomised members with implanted and experimental augmentations. These rarely live long.

>*Dark Heresy Core Rulebook* 2^(nd) ed. (2014), p. 337.

And if we look at specific examples of Servitors being created and the materials used to do so across the lore, we see a mix of both vat-grown and ‘organic’ examples – with plenty, and likely more, of the latter.

We have the example of an Ad Mech group in Varangantua on the world of Alecto turining criminals into Servitors (and dabbling in some criminality and tech heresyw hile doing so…). More info on this and plenty of relevant quotes here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/13j2k97/excerpt\_flesh\_and\_steel\_the\_business\_and\_body/](https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/13j2k97/excerpt_flesh_and_steel_the_business_and_body/)

For our purposes, a key passage is:

>Naked human beings were standing in a switchbacked line between high fences. Outside the fences Adeptus Mechanicus menials in environment suits stood guard with shock goads in hand. The people, all mature men and women, were shepherded down the caged walk like livestock. And they were food beasts being led to the slaughter, meat for the ravenous appetite of the Machine-God.

>The manufactorum produced servitors, but it was more akin to an abattoir than a workshop. Every surface was easily cleanable. Large plastek flaps divided areas from each other. Servitors with spray units surgically attached to their backs prowled about, hosing filth into slit drains set into the perfectly smooth, slanted floors. We walked above all this, past sentry pods on spikes occupied by galvanic rifle- snipers. Our path went from one end of the hall to the other, and I could see pretty much the whole sorting process, beginning to end.

>As the line slowly advanced, the people were passed through various scanning devices, most of them mounted in ugly, functional arches that let out a constant series of acceptance chimes. Occasionally, one would let out an angry blare, and the indicator lumens would flash red. The rejected person was then swallowed up by a trapdoor opening beneath their feet. From these pits wafted a hideous stench, and the grinding sounds of industrial mincers. One rejected man grabbed on to the lip and hung there, arms and hands bloodied, shouting a stream of defiant profanities. Guards lined the grating either side of him and shocked him until he fell. The adepts wouldn’t even waste bullets on these people.

>The trapdoor flipped up, and the next terrified person was ushered forward.

>A number of pneumatic gates separated the people from each part of the process, snapping open and shut with bone-crushing force.

>Violent metal arms snatched them up and spread-eagled them in the air, and a servitor shearer shaved them all over. At another they were subjected to a high-pressure counterseptic wash whose chemical stink made me choke from a hundred feet away. More scanners, more rejects winnowed out. Machines forcibly dressed them in the heavy rubberised garments common to all mono-tasked servitors. These were saggy on them, all one size, until another process force-shrank them to fit their bodies where metal cuffs, sockets and collars bit into vulnerable flesh. The last few prayers gave way to screams at that point, and even the most stoic shouted in pain. They were ushered over a floor buzzing with power that made them shriek with every footstep.

An example of a deal to ship people into a forgeworld in return for resources:

>Throughout the Age of Imperium, Cerix Magnus has led the forge worlds of Askellon, entering into a number of reciprocal arrangements with other factions including several nearby Knight worlds. In return for the supply of weapons and other advanced materiel they manufacture, the numerous other worlds serve what needs it cannot meet itself. These range from raw natural resources vital to manufacturing, to Knights and other forces in times of  conflict\*\*, to a supply of sinners to be converted into the many servitors each forge relies upon for its many tasks.\*\*

And bounty hunters playing a role in the servitor production system:

>Desoleum Bounty Hunter

>In Hive Desoleum, bounty hunters do not hunt men—for a man is inconsequential and easily replaced. Rather, they hunt oaths. Fundamentally, the commission of a crime is a violation of a citizen’s oath to hive and master. Should a citizen compound his offence by fleeing justice, he takes with him his yet-unfulfilled oath. **It is the job of oath hunters to track and return them to complete their service— possibly as a servitor**.

There was a deal between the Ecclesiarchy and Ad Mech to deal with overcrowding:

>As burial space on Granithor became precious due to crowding, the Ecclesiarchy looked to the moon as a means of dealing with ""lesser"" burials. At first, they began to ""dump"" unworthy aspirants, living as well as dead, on Donaris without ceremony or permission. Magos Artitaeus registered a formal complaint with the Sector Governor and the two sides met at the Scrobis Accords. Archbishop Sophatus, who represented the Ecclesiarchy at the Accords, was surprised that the Mechanicus not only accepted the situation, but insisted on including a clause requiring that all postulants turned away from Granithor be sent to Donaris and agreed that the dead should be placed in crypts that they would construct. They also stipulated an Ecclesiarchal enclave be created on the moon to monitor the Mechanicus' end of the arrangement, something that the Ministorum has subsequently come to view as a slap in the face. Leadership of the enclave has never been a popular position and is widely regarded as a mild punishment for past misdeeds.

>**The Mechanicus constructed the crypts as promised, but any living persons accompanying the dead — pall bearers and others of funeral parties — were evaluated for servitor production, and those found suitable... The Ecclesiarchy chafes under the concept that some members of their flock now fill the lowest ranks of the Omnissiah's congregation**, but the sheer volume of supplicants wishing to be buried on Granithor leaves them little choice but to accept the Accord's ""solution.""

>**The Mechanicus have steadily increased the size and scope of their facilities on Donaris ever since; and it is now one of the largest servitor production facilities outside of the Lathes**.

There is an example of the Adminstratum allowing the Ad Mech to turn farmers into Servitors to increase efficiency:

>Even the augmented forms of the Adeptus Mechanicus need sustenance, and after hearing of potential issues with harvests on Ostia, the Machine Cults of Avachrus engaged their cogitators and calculated a way to benefit. The Administratum gladly accepted the aid of their farming Servitors, even allowing them to convert the simple farmers into far more efficient lobotomised labourers, allowing the Adeptus Mechanicus to contest the power of the Ecclesiarchy on Ostia for the first time. But the earnest faith of the populace ensures that superstition runs rampant — the workforce fears and distrusts the tech-ghouls of the Mecha","are servitors mainly vat-grown , or made from living humans ? what the lore actually says * * tldr : there is no basis to claim the majority of servitors are vat-grown . the lore generally showcases that there are large proportions of both natural and vat-grown servitors . the only explicit statement we have states a greater proportion are made from natural humans . i survey the relevant lore across the decades . * * a bit of a minor ( which grew into a post ) , but i wanted to clarify something which is a surprisingly frequent topic of conversation – and which is accompanied by people making and claims . hopefully we are all aware of servitors : the mind-wiped ( though not always totally successfully… ) cyborg automatons which are ubiquitous across most of the imperium , undertaking a wide range of tasks . but where do the bodies used to produce servitors come from ? are they mainly vat-grown for the purpose ? or are the bodies and/or corpses of naturally-born people ( which i will refer to as ‘ organic ’ ) the main source ? if you look at discussions about servitors which appear on this sub and elsewhere , a lot of people claim – very confidently – that it is the former : that the majority ( or , sometimes , it is even claimed , the vast majority ) of servitors are vat-grown . but there is not really any basis in the lore to such a claim . the clearest statement we have about the ratio of servitors produced from vat-grown or once living people is : > most servitors are manufactured by the adeptus mechanicus , either from genetically-engineered humanoid clones created for the purpose , * * or more commonly from criminals sentenced to imperpituis * * , in which case their minds are wiped during processing . > * imperium maledictum core rulebook * ( 2023 ) , p. 322. so , it is stated that the use of criminals is more common than vat-grown clones . most often , we are just told that there are a mix of vat-grown bodies and people being turned into servitors , with no real info about the ratio – just a sense that both methods are common . the most extensive account ( , that i have found anyway ) is : > through ancient covenants with the emperor himself , the adepts of the cult mechanicus have a monopoly on and jurisdiction over the use of all technology . to alter a machine ’ s prescribed operation or structure , to with its inner workings without theological ministrations only a tech priest is privy to , are just some of the crimes for which the adeptus mechanicus is to administer punishment . lobotomised servitors – men and women who ran afoul of tech priests – are a common sight throughout the imperium . these unthinking creatures , heavily modified with bionic replacements , perform and tasks of every kind , and heir pallor and jaws are a potent reminder of the dangers of crossing the adeptus mechanicus . > * codex : adeptus mechanicus * 10^ ( th ) ed .

If y'all wanta follow along I am dedicating my entire full time attention to this. About 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. I am lucky that I have the means to be able to drop all my other work and focus on this. Cause what the fuck else matters if we lose our country to tyranny? It blows my mind these other creators can just go on about their days, I guess they'd rather be an influencer in nazi germany than lose followers. 

I am currently working on a big article documenting all of the specific contractors working for ICE that will be hiring on the 20,000 agents trump ordered in his May 9th executive order.

# Paramilitary Brownshirts! Being Created Now and It's All Legal!

My main focus has been on white supremacists and brownshirt paramilitaries because they are the greatest threat to the physical safety of immigrants and anyone who is standing up to the trump regime.

**I believe I just figured out their gameplan on how to create a paramilitary millions strong across the United States.**

Let me say that again. This is the regime’s gameplan on how to create a paramilitary in order to enact violence against their political enemies, detain millions of immigrants, and detain US citizen dissidents.

# What is 287(g)

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 added Section 287(g) to the Immigration and Nationality Act. This section authorizes ICE to give state and local law enforcement officers the authority to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties. Essentially, 287(g) agreements turn state and local police into arms of ICE, and divert the time and attention of local officers towards enforcing federal immigration law. Critically, law enforcement agencies can only participate in a 287(g) if the agreement doesn’t conflict with state or local laws. [https://www.nyclu.org/commentary/what-are-287g-agreements-and-how-do-they-fuel-trumps-mass-deportations](https://www.nyclu.org/commentary/what-are-287g-agreements-and-how-do-they-fuel-trumps-mass-deportations)

>Since January 20, the Trump administration has aggressively — yet quietly — expanded a controversial program that delegates immigration enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement agencies across the country that are normally prohibited from investigating and arresting non-citizens based on immigration violations. [https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/287g-the-program-that-lets-state-and-local-police-perform-the-functions-of-federal-immigration-officers/](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/287g-the-program-that-lets-state-and-local-police-perform-the-functions-of-federal-immigration-officers/)

# Ignore the Outrage

The regime and trump says a lot of outrageous things that make big headlines. He’s renaming veterans day. He wants to re-open Alcatraz. Ignore that. Those are distractions. It’s the things he’s doing in the quiet, in the dark that need to concern you.

This is all part of their strategy. Not everyone in the regime is stupid or incompetent. They want to give the perception of incompetence because that lets them do their damage in silence. This group of incompetent people have managed to put their puppet in power, have gained control of the house, the senate, and the majority in the Supreme Court. They have convinced \~25% of Americans to live in a completely separate reality bubble.

Don’t get distracted by the latest outrage. This is intentional. They are distracting you.

ICE is quietly creating agreements with local law enforcement and especially sheriffs. This has largely gone unreported and I’ve not seen anyone connect the dots yet.

* **Most 287(g) agreements were with county sheriffs**, rather than other enforcement agencies, for two reasons. First, sheriffs are elected, which means that they had a political incentive to incorporate immigration enforcement into their campaign platforms by publicly pursuing 287(g) agreements.[7](https://austinkocher.substack.com/p/trump-is-quietly-building-a-deportation#footnote-7-161305844) Second, sheriffs run the county jails where all law enforcement agencies in the county book people they arrest; thus, jails function as a strategic node for ICE in the larger enforcement system.

# Constitutional Sheriffs

Did you know there’s been a growing movement called “constitutional sheriffs” that started in 2011?

# What is the “Constitutional Sheriffs” movement?

>

More simply, these are MAGA sheriffs. And the alarming fact is that sheriffs in the United States hold a scary amount of power and autonomy.

A new report from the Reflective Democracy Campaign - that's a research organization - analyzed data on elected sheriffs around the country. And a report concluded that they have, **""unparalleled autonomy and tremendous power,""** i**n the communities they police with very little accountability.** Their findings are published in a new report called Confronting The Demographics Of Power: America's Sheriffs. [https://www.npr.org/2020/07/25/895423249/do-elected-sheriffs-have-outsized-power-in-the-u-s](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/25/895423249/do-elected-sheriffs-have-outsized-power-in-the-u-s)

>

Sheriffs hold a host of powers, from overseeing jails, transporting prisoners and pre-trial detainees, and acting as coroners in addition to all of the normal powers associated with law enforcement officers like investigating, making arrests, serving warrants, etc.

“Despite their broad duties, sheriffs and their deputies aren’t always trained in law enforcement. Elected sheriffs may have backgrounds in business or real estate instead. Patronage can run strong in sheriffs’ departments, with some deputies hired as political favors.” [https://theappeal.org/the-power-of-sheriffs-an-explainer/](https://theappeal.org/the-power-of-sheriffs-an-explainer/)

**A staggering 60% of sheriffs run unopposed.** There’s a reason that thrillers like Jack Reacher often have a corrupt sheriff as an antagonist. Because the system is ripe for abuse and has been abused throughout the history of the United States. It is an incredible amount of power given to an elected official that has very little oversight or accountability. Of course it’s going to be abused.

It’s hard to find specific data but in many states sheriff deputies are not required by law **to have any formal training, like attending the police academy** before they’re given a badge, a gun, and are allowed to carry out law enforcement duties. “Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler apologized to members of a state board that enforces law enforcement training standards for allowing two of his appointees to participate in an armed raid without proper certification, saying he didn't know they weren't qualified.” [https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2025/02/18/knox-county-sheriff-spangler-apologizes-uncertified-appointees-armed-raids-jerry-glenn-eric-edlin/78620397007/](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2025/02/18/knox-county-sheriff-spangler-apologizes-uncertified-appointees-armed-raids-jerry-glenn-eric-edlin/78620397007/)

Here’s an article from Slate, In Arkansas and Indiana, you can become a police officer without any formal training.

# Sheriff’s Posse’s Aren’t Just Wild West Trope, They Are a Reality in 2025

In rural Klickitat County, Sheriff Bob Songer — who has drawn national attention for his belief that sheriffs have the constitutional authority to decide which laws they will enforce — **has been building a posse of volunteers nearly 10 times larger than the number of deputies**, InvestigateWest’s Paul Kiefer reported. **The posse is accountable to Songer alone, and he has warned that if the federal or state government tried to confiscate civilian firearms, he would use the posse to fight back.** The posse has drawn concerns from residents worried about Songer’s association with far-right movements, as well as the potential liability to the county in the event of a violent encounter between a posse member and a citizen. [https://www.investigatewest.org/news/a-controversial-sheriffs-posse-an-uninvestigated-disappearance-and-a-wealth-of-obstacles-to-public-records-a-year-of-investigative-report-17757349](https://www.investigatewest.org/news/a-controversial-sheriffs-posse-an-uninvestigated-disappearance-and-a-wealth-of-obstacles-to-public-records-a-year-of-investigative-report-17757349)

Songer is a central figure in the “constitutional sheriffs” movement, founded on the theory that county sheriffs have the authority to decide which state or federal laws they can enforce. He cemented his place in that movement — drawing national attention in the process — by publicly refusing to enforce gun control laws and pandemic-era public health rules. If federal or state authorities attempted to confiscate civilian firearms on his turf, Songer has warned that he would call upon the posse to help him fight back — a hypothetical showdown he once compared to the Bundy family standoffs in Nevada and Oregon a decade ago.

**“I would call upon the citizens of the county, not just the posse, and I would deputize them,” he told InvestigateWest. “We would resist if they come in and take guns away from good citizens.”** [https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2024/10/20/sheriff-in-washington-state-has-growing-volunteer-posse-at-command/75724149007/](https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2024/10/20/sheriff-in-washington-state-has-growing-volunteer-posse-at-command/75724149007/)

Elsewhere, sheriffs have occasionally used posses for explicitly political purposes. In Culpeper County, Virginia, [federal prosecutors indicted](https://boltsmag.org/culpeper-virginia-sheriff/) a constitutional sheriff for allegedly accepting $70,000 in campaign contributions between 2019 and 2023 in exchange for making donors part of his volunteer auxiliary and providing access to firearms. **In Arizona, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s so-called “Cold Case Posse” attracted** [**attention**](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2016/11/12/maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio-heads-exit-posse-obama-birther-probe-remain-mystery/93212380/) **in 2011 when its members began investigating the validity of then-President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Arpaio’s successor** [**disbanded**](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/01/19/maricopa-county-sheriff-paul-penzone-unveils-100-day-plan-for-office/96776750/) **that posse in 2017.**

Another branch of Maricopa County’s posse — **which once boasted as many as 3,000 members — took part in Arpaio’s trademark hunt for undocumented immigrants, including participating in traffic stops, worksite raids and crowd control operations.** Those posse activities factored into a [costly](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-05-21/taxpayer-costs-for-profiling-verdict-over-joe-arpaios-immigration-crackdowns-to-reach-314m) racial discrimination lawsuit in 2012 that played a key role in transforming Arizona into a [battleground state](https://www.hcn.org/articles/books-how-activists-fought-joe-arpaios-immigration-roundups/).

The most obvious opportunity for the posse to act as enforcers for Songer’s political beliefs came during two **Black Lives Matter protests in Klickitat County in 2020 — one in White Salmon, and another in nearby Lyle. Songer routinely refers to the Black Lives Matter movement as a source of “domestic terrorism,” and he told InvestigateWest that he deployed armed posse members to “keep an eye” on the protests and intervene in the event of rioting.**

Indeed, Washington law provides practically no framework for volunteer sheriff’s posses. [State statutes](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28.010) allow sheriffs to call upon civilians to help respond to riots, search for fugitives or serve civil court documents, but leave the details to the sheriffs themselves.

**“It’s a blank check,”** said state Rep. Roger Goodman, D-Kirkland, chair of Washington’s House Public Safety Committee. [https://www.investigatewest.org/investigatewest-reports/in-a-rural-stretch-of-washington-a-constitutional-sheriff-and-his-growing-volunteer-posse-provoke-controversy-17706597](https://www.investigatewest.org/investigatewest-reports/in-a-rural-stretch-of-washington-a-constitutional-sheriff-and-his-growing-volunteer-posse-provoke-controversy-17706597)

# Sheriff’s Have Broad Powers to Deputize ANYONE

The laws vary from state to state but sheriff’s have broad powers to deputize.

>

So imagine this hypothetical scenario. The trump regime has stated that they want to detain 12 million “illegal immigrants.” Currently ICE only has 50,000 officers. They simply don’t have the manpower to carry out their stated goal.

There’s no way they can hire on the hundreds of thousands of officers they’d need to accomplish their goal to ICE. Federal law enforcement have strict hiring standards and the pipeline to go from application to boots on the ground working for ICE is two to three years.

They need a different scheme and to leverage infrastructure and laws that are already in place. This regime is great at finding obscure laws to legitimize their otherwise illegal and unconstitutional schemes, like using the Alien Enemies act to deport immigrants without due process. This scheme using 287(g) to bring local law enforcement and especially sheriffs departments under the control of ICE is devious and it is legal.

These constitutional sheriffs can then use their existing posses, and create new posses and deputize random civilians. Everyone in this chain of command has legal law enforcement authority because they’ve been deputized by the sheriffs. And everyone has legal authority to enforce immigration law because they’ve been deputized by ICE under 287(g). They will have the legal authority to “enforce immigration policy,” aka detain people with too much melanin in their skin.

# This Isn’t Fearmongering, Mercenary Contractor Blackwater was Deputized in Katrina

About 150 heavily armed Blackwater troops dressed in full battle gear spread out into the chaos of New Orleans. Officially, the company boasted of its forces ""join\[ing\] the hurricane relief effort."" But its men on the ground told a different story.

In an hourlong conversation I had with four Blackwater men, they characterized their work in New Orleans as **""securing neighborhoods"" and ""confronting criminals.""** They all carried automatic assault weapons and had guns strapped to their legs. Their flak jackets were covered with pouches for extra ammunition.

When asked what authority they were operating under, one guy said, **""We're on contract with the Department of Homeland Security.""** Then, pointing to one of his comrades, he said, ""He was even deputized by the governor of the state of Louisiana. We can make arrests and use lethal force if we deem it necessary."" The man then held up the gold **Louisiana law enforcement badge he wore around his neck.** **Blackwater spokesperson Anne Duke also said the company has a letter from Louisiana officials authorizing its forces to carry loaded weapons.**

Blackwater is not alone. As business leaders and government officials talk openly of changing the demographics of what was one of the most culturally vibrant of America's cities, mercenaries from companies like **DynCorp, Intercon, American Security Group, Blackhawk, Wackenhut and an Israeli company called Instinctive Shooting International (ISI) are fanning out to guard private businesses and homes, as well as government projects and institutions.** Within two weeks of the hurricane, the number of private security companies registered in Louisiana jumped from 185 to 235. Some, like Blackwater, are under federal contract. Others have been hired by the wealthy elite, like F. Patrick Quinn III, who brought in private security to guard his $3 million private estate and his luxury hotels, which are under consideration for a lucrative federal contract to house FEMA workers.

A possibly deadly incident involving Quinn's hired guns underscores the dangers of private forces policing American streets. On his second night in New Orleans, Quinn's security chief, Michael Montgomery, who said he worked for an Alabama company called Bodyguard and Tactical Security (BATS), was with a heavily armed security detail en route to pick up one of Quinn's associates and escort him through the chaotic city. Montgomery told me they came under fire from ""black gangbangers"" on an overpass near the poor Ninth Ward neighborhood. ""At the time, I was on the phone with my business partner,"" he recalls. ""I dropped the phone and returned fire.""

Montgomery says he and his men were armed with AR-15s and Glocks and that they unleashed a barrage of bullets in the general direction of the alleged shooters on the overpass. **""After that, all I heard was moaning and screaming, and the shooting stopped. That was it. Enough said.""** [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackwater-down/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackwater-down/)

# This is trump’s Paramilitary Brownshirt Army

Del Norte Sheriff Garrett Scott has announced **Merced County Sheriff's Posse** will be participating and **leading the parade on the Inauguration on President Donald J. Trump.**

Merced County Sheriff Vern Wernke released this amazing news and acknowledged Sheriff Scott and the **Del Norte County Sheriff's Posse** will be helping with financial donations. Merced County Sheriff's Posse is setting up its mounted posse unit, expediently. Funds are sought for horse feed and shelter for the Merced team.

This is not the first Rodeo for the Merced Posse. The Posse participated in President Trumps first Inauguration in 2017 and were in fact the only representatives from the Golden State for this historical event. [https://www.triplicate.com/news/merced-county-sheriffs-posse-to-lead-the-inauguration-of-president-elect-trump/article\_4b905186-c932-11ef-b87f-07bb639787c8.html](https://www.triplicate.com/news/merced-county-sheriffs-posse-to-lead-the-inauguration-of-president-elect-trump/article_4b905186-c932-11ef-b87f-07bb639787c8.html)

That’s right. A sheriff’s posse lead the parade for the trump inauguration. I would bet my life savings that most people reading this article have never heard the word sheriff posse and trump in the same sentence. I bet most of you didn’t know that sheriff posse’s were still a thing in 2025. I certainly didn’t until I started doing this research.

Remember, it’s the silent pieces that should alarm you.

The trump’s regime is clearly aware of the existence of these posse’s. They had them lead their little inauguration parade.

# Connecting the Dots

287(g) creates a command and control structure that allows ICE to oversee all of these disparate local law enforcement agencies. It centralizes the power of local law enforcement agencies in the federal government. Centralizing the power of local law enforcement behind the federal government, something these constitutional sheriffs and other anti-government, anti-fed libertarian types have been warning against for decades.

>

Turns out that the virulent racism that runs through the veins of these sheriffs win out over their fear of federal government overreach. Turns out that it was never about protecting the constitution. Turns out that their issue with the federal government all along was with the person in charge(a black man named Barack Obama). This entire movement sprung up under the Obama presidency and has now been given legitimacy under trump.

# The Blueprint for the Brownshirt Paramilitary

* 287(g) allows the trump regime to control and give broad immigration enforcement powers to local law enforcement agencies
* 287(g) gives the federal government streamlined communications and cooperation with local law enforcement agencies. It creates a chain of command, in other words it creates a command and control structure for the federal government to direct the actions of local LEOs.
* “Constitutional Sheriffs” have already established posses who have already participated in intimidating Black Lives Matter protestors and performed armed “immigration enforcement” patrols along the southern border.
* Sheriffs have the broad power to deputize anyone they want, giving legal authority to carry firearms and perform law enforcement duties including the use of deadly force.
* These posses have **already carried out immigration enforcement activities in Arizona.** “Another branch of Maricopa County’s posse — which once boasted as many as 3,000 members — took part in Arpaio’s trademark hunt for undocumented immigrants, including participating in traffic stops, worksite raids and crowd control operations.”
* Deputizing armed, non-LEO citizens and giving them the authority to use deadly force is not unprecedented. The federal government deputized Blackwater, a private military mercenary group during hurricane Katrina and gave them broad powers to carry weapons and use deadly force. Eric Prince, the founder of Blackwater, has submitted a $25 billion proposal to create a “private Army” to round up “illegal immigrants.” [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/military-contractors-prison-plan-detained-immigrants-erik-prince-00287208](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/military-contractors-prison-plan-detained-immigrants-erik-prince-00287208)
* Sheriffs will gather posses, deputize civilians and grant broad legal powers. This is my own speculation but I believe they will likely tap white supremacy militias and the like for their posses. This will form the backbone of the new brownshirt paramilitary army.
* Mercenary contractor groups will be deputized under this scheme to give more teeth to the organizations. Many of these mercenary contractors are former US military and special operations.

I believe we are already seeing this in action. The videos showing completely untrained, unfit, ununiformed, masked men who fail to identify themselves is an indicator that this is already happening. My speculation is that ICE is using contractors, like G4S, and sending out one real agent to lead a gang of these contractors on raids. The contractors are the hired muscle and the real federal agent brings legitimacy and command and control.

This will be their model across the US. Their posse and deputized white supremacists will be the muscle, lead by actual trained law enforcement. They will be used to enact violence against the regime’s political enemies and carry out their brutal detention of millions of immigrants. And if you think it only stops at “illegal immigrants” you are ignoring the history of every damn authoritarian regime.

Mercenary contractors, like Blackwater(now Constellis Holdings), will perform more specialized raids on the homes of politicians, journalists, intellectuals, and activists. They will be used to kidnap and disappear prominent leaders in the resistance against the regime. Of course these folks will have trumped up charges of aiding and abetting terrorists and whatever else laid upon them to give the veneer of legality.

And folks this will all be perfectly legal under our current laws.

Scroll to the bottom on this page to download a list of current 287(g) participants and see if your local law enforcement are participating.

If y'all wanta follow along I am dedicating my entire full time attention to this. About 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. I am lucky that I have the means to be able to drop all my other work and focus on this. Cause what the fuck else matters if we lose our country to tyranny? It blows my mind these other creators can just go on about their days, I guess they'd rather be an influencer in nazi germany than lose followers. 

I am currently working on a big article documenting all of the specific contractors working for ICE that will be hiring on the 20,000 agents trump ordered in his May 9th executive order.

# Paramilitary Brownshirts! Being Created Now and It's All Legal!

My main focus has been on white supremacists and brownshirt paramilitaries because they are the greatest threat to the physical safety of immigrants and anyone who is standing up to the trump regime.

**I believe I just figured out their gameplan on how to create a paramilitary millions strong across the United States.**

Let me say that again. This is the regime’s gameplan on how to create a paramilitary in order to enact violence against their political enemies, detain millions of immigrants, and detain US citizen dissidents.

# What is 287(g)

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 added Section 287(g) to the Immigration and Nationality Act. This section authorizes ICE to give state and local law enforcement officers the authority to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties. Essentially, 287(g) agreements turn state and local police into arms of ICE, and divert the time and attention of local officers towards enforcing federal immigration law. Critically, law enforcement agencies can only participate in a 287(g) if the agreement doesn’t conflict with state or local laws. [https://www.nyclu.org/commentary/what-are-287g-agreements-and-how-do-they-fuel-trumps-mass-deportations](https://www.nyclu.org/commentary/what-are-287g-agreements-and-how-do-they-fuel-trumps-mass-deportations)

>Since January 20, the Trump administration has aggressively — yet quietly — expanded a controversial program that delegates immigration enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement agencies across the country that are normally prohibited from investigating and arresting non-citizens based on immigration violations. [https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/287g-the-program-that-lets-state-and-local-police-perform-the-functions-of-federal-immigration-officers/](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/287g-the-program-that-lets-state-and-local-police-perform-the-functions-of-federal-immigration-officers/)

# Ignore the Outrage

The regime and trump says a lot of outrageous things that make big headlines. He’s renaming veterans day. He wants to re-open Alcatraz. Ignore that. Those are distractions. It’s the things he’s doing in the quiet, in the dark that need to concern you.

This is all part of their strategy. Not everyone in the regime is stupid or incompetent. They want to give the perception of incompetence because that lets them do their damage in silence. This group of incompetent people have managed to put their puppet in power, have gained control of the house, the senate, and the majority in the Supreme Court. They have convinced \~25% of Americans to live in a completely separate reality bubble.

Don’t get distracted by the latest outrage. This is intentional. They are distracting you.

ICE is quietly creating agreements with local law enforcement and especially sheriffs. This has largely gone unreported and I’ve not seen anyone connect the dots yet.

* **Most 287(g) agreements were with county sheriffs**, rather than other enforcement agencies, for two reasons. First, sheriffs are elected, which means that they had a political incentive to incorporate immigration enforcement into their campaign platforms by publicly pursuing 287(g) agreements.[7](https://austinkocher.substack.com/p/trump-is-quietly-building-a-deportation#footnote-7-161305844) Second, sheriffs run the county jails where all law enforcement agencies in the county book people they arrest; thus, jails function as a strategic node for ICE in the larger enforcement system.

# Constitutional Sheriffs

Did you know there’s been a growing movement called “constitutional sheriffs” that started in 2011?

# What is the “Constitutional Sheriffs” movement?

>

More simply, these are MAGA sheriffs. And the alarming fact is that sheriffs in the United States hold a scary amount of power and autonomy.

A new report from the Reflective Democracy Campaign - that's a research organization - analyzed data on elected sheriffs around the country. And a report concluded that they have, **""unparalleled autonomy and tremendous power,""** i**n the communities they police with very little accountability.** Their findings are published in a new report called Confronting The Demographics Of Power: America's Sheriffs. [https://www.npr.org/2020/07/25/895423249/do-elected-sheriffs-have-outsized-power-in-the-u-s](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/25/895423249/do-elected-sheriffs-have-outsized-power-in-the-u-s)

>

Sheriffs hold a host of powers, from overseeing jails, transporting prisoners and pre-trial detainees, and acting as coroners in addition to all of the normal powers associated with law enforcement officers like investigating, making arrests, serving warrants, etc.

“Despite their broad duties, sheriffs and their deputies aren’t always trained in law enforcement. Elected sheriffs may have backgrounds in business or real estate instead. Patronage can run strong in sheriffs’ departments, with some deputies hired as political favors.” [https://theappeal.org/the-power-of-sheriffs-an-explainer/](https://theappeal.org/the-power-of-sheriffs-an-explainer/)

**A staggering 60% of sheriffs run unopposed.** There’s a reason that thrillers like Jack Reacher often have a corrupt sheriff as an antagonist. Because the system is ripe for abuse and has been abused throughout the history of the United States. It is an incredible amount of power given to an elected official that has very little oversight or accountability. Of course it’s going to be abused.

It’s hard to find specific data but in many states sheriff deputies are not required by law **to have any formal training, like attending the police academy** before they’re given a badge, a gun, and are allowed to carry out law enforcement duties. “Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler apologized to members of a state board that enforces law enforcement training standards for allowing two of his appointees to participate in an armed raid without proper certification, saying he didn't know they weren't qualified.” [https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2025/02/18/knox-county-sheriff-spangler-apologizes-uncertified-appointees-armed-raids-jerry-glenn-eric-edlin/78620397007/](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2025/02/18/knox-county-sheriff-spangler-apologizes-uncertified-appointees-armed-raids-jerry-glenn-eric-edlin/78620397007/)

Here’s an article from Slate, In Arkansas and Indiana, you can become a police officer without any formal training.

# Sheriff’s Posse’s Aren’t Just Wild West Trope, They Are a Reality in 2025

In rural Klickitat County, Sheriff Bob Songer — who has drawn national attention for his belief that sheriffs have the constitutional authority to decide which laws they will enforce — **has been building a posse of volunteers nearly 10 times larger than the number of deputies**, InvestigateWest’s Paul Kiefer reported. **The posse is accountable to Songer alone, and he has warned that if the federal or state government tried to confiscate civilian firearms, he would use the posse to fight back.** The posse has drawn concerns from residents worried about Songer’s association with far-right movements, as well as the potential liability to the county in the event of a violent encounter between a posse member and a citizen. [https://www.investigatewest.org/news/a-controversial-sheriffs-posse-an-uninvestigated-disappearance-and-a-wealth-of-obstacles-to-public-records-a-year-of-investigative-report-17757349](https://www.investigatewest.org/news/a-controversial-sheriffs-posse-an-uninvestigated-disappearance-and-a-wealth-of-obstacles-to-public-records-a-year-of-investigative-report-17757349)

Songer is a central figure in the “constitutional sheriffs” movement, founded on the theory that county sheriffs have the authority to decide which state or federal laws they can enforce. He cemented his place in that movement — drawing national attention in the process — by publicly refusing to enforce gun control laws and pandemic-era public health rules. If federal or state authorities attempted to confiscate civilian firearms on his turf, Songer has warned that he would call upon the posse to help him fight back — a hypothetical showdown he once compared to the Bundy family standoffs in Nevada and Oregon a decade ago.

**“I would call upon the citizens of the county, not just the posse, and I would deputize them,” he told InvestigateWest. “We would resist if they come in and take guns away from good citizens.”** [https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2024/10/20/sheriff-in-washington-state-has-growing-volunteer-posse-at-command/75724149007/](https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2024/10/20/sheriff-in-washington-state-has-growing-volunteer-posse-at-command/75724149007/)

Elsewhere, sheriffs have occasionally used posses for explicitly political purposes. In Culpeper County, Virginia, [federal prosecutors indicted](https://boltsmag.org/culpeper-virginia-sheriff/) a constitutional sheriff for allegedly accepting $70,000 in campaign contributions between 2019 and 2023 in exchange for making donors part of his volunteer auxiliary and providing access to firearms. **In Arizona, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s so-called “Cold Case Posse” attracted** [**attention**](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2016/11/12/maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio-heads-exit-posse-obama-birther-probe-remain-mystery/93212380/) **in 2011 when its members began investigating the validity of then-President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Arpaio’s successor** [**disbanded**](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/01/19/maricopa-county-sheriff-paul-penzone-unveils-100-day-plan-for-office/96776750/) **that posse in 2017.**

Another branch of Maricopa County’s posse — **which once boasted as many as 3,000 members — took part in Arpaio’s trademark hunt for undocumented immigrants, including participating in traffic stops, worksite raids and crowd control operations.** Those posse activities factored into a [costly](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-05-21/taxpayer-costs-for-profiling-verdict-over-joe-arpaios-immigration-crackdowns-to-reach-314m) racial discrimination lawsuit in 2012 that played a key role in transforming Arizona into a [battleground state](https://www.hcn.org/articles/books-how-activists-fought-joe-arpaios-immigration-roundups/).

The most obvious opportunity for the posse to act as enforcers for Songer’s political beliefs came during two **Black Lives Matter protests in Klickitat County in 2020 — one in White Salmon, and another in nearby Lyle. Songer routinely refers to the Black Lives Matter movement as a source of “domestic terrorism,” and he told InvestigateWest that he deployed armed posse members to “keep an eye” on the protests and intervene in the event of rioting.**

Indeed, Washington law provides practically no framework for volunteer sheriff’s posses. [State statutes](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28.010) allow sheriffs to call upon civilians to help respond to riots, search for fugitives or serve civil court documents, but leave the details to the sheriffs themselves.

**“It’s a blank check,”** said state Rep. Roger Goodman, D-Kirkland, chair of Washington’s House Public Safety Committee. [https://www.investigatewest.org/investigatewest-reports/in-a-rural-stretch-of-washington-a-constitutional-sheriff-and-his-growing-volunteer-posse-provoke-controversy-17706597](https://www.investigatewest.org/investigatewest-reports/in-a-rural-stretch-of-washington-a-constitutional-sheriff-and-his-growing-volunteer-posse-provoke-controversy-17706597)

# Sheriff’s Have Broad Powers to Deputize ANYONE

The laws vary from state to state but sheriff’s have broad powers to deputize.

>

So imagine this hypothetical scenario. The trump regime has stated that they want to detain 12 million “illegal immigrants.” Currently ICE only has 50,000 officers. They simply don’t have the manpower to carry out their stated goal.

There’s no way they can hire on the hundreds of thousands of officers they’d need to accomplish their goal to ICE. Federal law enforcement have strict hiring standards and the pipeline to go from application to boots on the ground working for ICE is two to three years.

They need a different scheme and to leverage infrastructure and laws that are already in place. This regime is great at finding obscure laws to legitimize their otherwise illegal and unconstitutional schemes, like using the Alien Enemies act to deport immigrants without due process. This scheme using 287(g) to bring local law enforcement and especially sheriffs departments under the control of ICE is devious and it is legal.

These constitutional sheriffs can then use their existing posses, and create new posses and deputize random civilians. Everyone in this chain of command has legal law enforcement authority because they’ve been deputized by the sheriffs. And everyone has legal authority to enforce immigration law because they’ve been deputized by ICE under 287(g). They will have the legal authority to “enforce immigration policy,” aka detain people with too much melanin in their skin.

# This Isn’t Fearmongering, Mercenary Contractor Blackwater was Deputized in Katrina

About 150 heavily armed Blackwater troops dressed in full battle gear spread out into the chaos of New Orleans. Officially, the company boasted of its forces ""join\[ing\] the hurricane relief effort."" But its men on the ground told a different story.

In an hourlong conversation I had with four Blackwater men, they characterized their work in New Orleans as **""securing neighborhoods"" and ""confronting criminals.""** They all carried automatic assault weapons and had guns strapped to their legs. Their flak jackets were covered with pouches for extra ammunition.

When asked what authority they were operating under, one guy said, **""We're on contract with the Department of Homeland Security.""** Then, pointing to one of his comrades, he said, ""He was even deputized by the governor of the state of Louisiana. We can make arrests and use lethal force if we deem it necessary."" The man then held up the gold **Louisiana law enforcement badge he wore around his neck.** **Blackwater spokesperson Anne Duke also said the company has a letter from Louisiana officials authorizing its forces to carry loaded weapons.**

Blackwater is not alone. As business leaders and government officials talk openly of changing the demographics of what was one of the most culturally vibrant of America's cities, mercenaries from companies like **DynCorp, Intercon, American Security Group, Blackhawk, Wackenhut and an Israeli company called Instinctive Shooting International (ISI) are fanning out to guard private businesses and homes, as well as government projects and institutions.** Within two weeks of the hurricane, the number of private security companies registered in Louisiana jumped from 185 to 235. Some, like Blackwater, are under federal contract. Others have been hired by the wealthy elite, like F. Patrick Quinn III, who brought in private security to guard his $3 million private estate and his luxury hotels, which are under consideration for a lucrative federal contract to house FEMA workers.

A possibly deadly incident involving Quinn's hired guns underscores the dangers of private forces policing American streets. On his second night in New Orleans, Quinn's security chief, Michael Montgomery, who said he worked for an Alabama company called Bodyguard and Tactical Security (BATS), was with a heavily armed security detail en route to pick up one of Quinn's associates and escort him through the chaotic city. Montgomery told me they came under fire from ""black gangbangers"" on an overpass near the poor Ninth Ward neighborhood. ""At the time, I was on the phone with my business partner,"" he recalls. ""I dropped the phone and returned fire.""

Montgomery says he and his men were armed with AR-15s and Glocks and that they unleashed a barrage of bullets in the general direction of the alleged shooters on the overpass. **""After that, all I heard was moaning and screaming, and the shooting stopped. That was it. Enough said.""** [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackwater-down/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackwater-down/)

# This is trump’s Paramilitary Brownshirt Army

Del Norte Sheriff Garrett Scott has announced **Merced County Sheriff's Posse** will be participating and **leading the parade on the Inauguration on President Donald J. Trump.**

Merced County Sheriff Vern Wernke released this amazing news and acknowledged Sheriff Scott and the **Del Norte County Sheriff's Posse** will be helping with financial donations. Merced County Sheriff's Posse is setting up its mounted posse unit, expediently. Funds are sought for horse feed and shelter for the Merced team.

This is not the first Rodeo for the Merced Posse. The Posse participated in President Trumps first Inauguration in 2017 and were in fact the only representatives from the Golden State for this historical event. [https://www.triplicate.com/news/merced-county-sheriffs-posse-to-lead-the-inauguration-of-president-elect-trump/article\_4b905186-c932-11ef-b87f-07bb639787c8.html](https://www.triplicate.com/news/merced-county-sheriffs-posse-to-lead-the-inauguration-of-president-elect-trump/article_4b905186-c932-11ef-b87f-07bb639787c8.html)

That’s right. A sheriff’s posse lead the parade for the trump inauguration. I would bet my life savings that most people reading this article have never heard the word sheriff posse and trump in the same sentence. I bet most of you didn’t know that sheriff posse’s were still a thing in 2025. I certainly didn’t until I started doing this research.

Remember, it’s the silent pieces that should alarm you.

The trump’s regime is clearly aware of the existence of these posse’s. They had them lead their little inauguration parade.

# Connecting the Dots

287(g) creates a command and control structure that allows ICE to oversee all of these disparate local law enforcement agencies. It centralizes the power of local law enforcement agencies in the federal government. Centralizing the power of local law enforcement behind the federal government, something these constitutional sheriffs and other anti-government, anti-fed libertarian types have been warning against for decades.

>

Turns out that the virulent racism that runs through the veins of these sheriffs win out over their fear of federal government overreach. Turns out that it was never about protecting the constitution. Turns out that their issue with the federal government all along was with the person in charge(a black man named Barack Obama). This entire movement sprung up under the Obama presidency and has now been given legitimacy under trump.

# The Blueprint for the Brownshirt Paramilitary

* 287(g) allows the trump regime to control and give broad immigration enforcement powers to local law enforcement agencies
* 287(g) gives the federal government streamlined communications and cooperation with local law enforcement agencies. It creates a chain of command, in other words it creates a command and control structure for the federal government to direct the actions of local LEOs.
* “Constitutional Sheriffs” have already established posses who have already participated in intimidating Black Lives Matter protestors and performed armed “immigration enforcement” patrols along the southern border.
* Sheriffs have the broad power to deputize anyone they want, giving legal authority to carry firearms and perform law enforcement duties including the use of deadly force.
* These posses have **already carried out immigration enforcement activities in Arizona.** “Another branch of Maricopa County’s posse — which once boasted as many as 3,000 members — took part in Arpaio’s trademark hunt for undocumented immigrants, including participating in traffic stops, worksite raids and crowd control operations.”
* Deputizing armed, non-LEO citizens and giving them the authority to use deadly force is not unprecedented. The federal government deputized Blackwater, a private military mercenary group during hurricane Katrina and gave them broad powers to carry weapons and use deadly force. Eric Prince, the founder of Blackwater, has submitted a $25 billion proposal to create a “private Army” to round up “illegal immigrants.” [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/military-contractors-prison-plan-detained-immigrants-erik-prince-00287208](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/military-contractors-prison-plan-detained-immigrants-erik-prince-00287208)
* Sheriffs will gather posses, deputize civilians and grant broad legal powers. This is my own speculation but I believe they will likely tap white supremacy militias and the like for their posses. This will form the backbone of the new brownshirt paramilitary army.
* Mercenary contractor groups will be deputized under this scheme to give more teeth to the organizations. Many of these mercenary contractors are former US military and special operations.

I believe we are already seeing this in action. The videos showing completely untrained, unfit, ununiformed, masked men who fail to identify themselves is an indicator that this is already happening. My speculation is that ICE is using contractors, like G4S, and sending out one real agent to lead a gang of these contractors on raids. The contractors are the hired muscle and the real federal agent brings legitimacy and command and control.

This will be their model across the US. Their posse and deputized white supremacists will be the muscle, lead by actual trained law enforcement. They will be used to enact violence against the regime’s political enemies and carry out their brutal detention of millions of immigrants. And if you think it only stops at “illegal immigrants” you are ignoring the history of every damn authoritarian regime.

Mercenary contractors, like Blackwater(now Constellis Holdings), will perform more specialized raids on the homes of politicians, journalists, intellectuals, and activists. They will be used to kidnap and disappear prominent leaders in the resistance against the regime. Of course these folks will have trumped up charges of aiding and abetting terrorists and whatever else laid upon them to give the veneer of legality.

And folks this will all be perfectly legal under our current laws.

# Paramilitary Brownshirts! Being Created Now and It's All Legal!

My main focus has been on white supremacists and brownshirt paramilitaries because they are the greatest threat to the physical safety of immigrants and anyone who is standing up to the trump regime.

**I believe I just figured out their gameplan on how to create a paramilitary millions strong across the United States.**

Let me say that again. This is the regime’s gameplan on how to create a paramilitary in order to enact violence against their political enemies, detain millions of immigrants, and detain US citizen dissidents.

# What is 287(g)

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 added Section 287(g) to the Immigration and Nationality Act. This section authorizes ICE to give state and local law enforcement officers the authority to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties. Essentially, 287(g) agreements turn state and local police into arms of ICE, and divert the time and attention of local officers towards enforcing federal immigration law. Critically, law enforcement agencies can only participate in a 287(g) if the agreement doesn’t conflict with state or local laws. [https://www.nyclu.org/commentary/what-are-287g-agreements-and-how-do-they-fuel-trumps-mass-deportations](https://www.nyclu.org/commentary/what-are-287g-agreements-and-how-do-they-fuel-trumps-mass-deportations)

>Since January 20, the Trump administration has aggressively — yet quietly — expanded a controversial program that delegates immigration enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement agencies across the country that are normally prohibited from investigating and arresting non-citizens based on immigration violations. [https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/287g-the-program-that-lets-state-and-local-police-perform-the-functions-of-federal-immigration-officers/](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/287g-the-program-that-lets-state-and-local-police-perform-the-functions-of-federal-immigration-officers/)

# Ignore the Outrage

The regime and trump says a lot of outrageous things that make big headlines. He’s renaming veterans day. He wants to re-open Alcatraz. Ignore that. Those are distractions. It’s the things he’s doing in the quiet, in the dark that need to concern you.

This is all part of their strategy. Not everyone in the regime is stupid or incompetent. They want to give the perception of incompetence because that lets them do their damage in silence. This group of incompetent people have managed to put their puppet in power, have gained control of the house, the senate, and the majority in the Supreme Court. They have convinced \~25% of Americans to live in a completely separate reality bubble.

Don’t get distracted by the latest outrage. This is intentional. They are distracting you.

ICE is quietly creating agreements with local law enforcement and especially sheriffs. This has largely gone unreported and I’ve not seen anyone connect the dots yet.

* **Most 287(g) agreements were with county sheriffs**, rather than other enforcement agencies, for two reasons. First, sheriffs are elected, which means that they had a political incentive to incorporate immigration enforcement into their campaign platforms by publicly pursuing 287(g) agreements.[7](https://austinkocher.substack.com/p/trump-is-quietly-building-a-deportation#footnote-7-161305844) Second, sheriffs run the county jails where all law enforcement agencies in the county book people they arrest; thus, jails function as a strategic node for ICE in the larger enforcement system.

# Constitutional Sheriffs

Did you know there’s been a growing movement called “constitutional sheriffs” that started in 2011?

# What is the “Constitutional Sheriffs” movement?

>

More simply, these are MAGA sheriffs. And the alarming fact is that sheriffs in the United States hold a scary amount of power and autonomy.

A new report from the Reflective Democracy Campaign - that's a research organization - analyzed data on elected sheriffs around the country. And a report concluded that they have, **""unparalleled autonomy and tremendous power,""** i**n the communities they police with very little accountability.** Their findings are published in a new report called Confronting The Demographics Of Power: America's Sheriffs. [https://www.npr.org/2020/07/25/895423249/do-elected-sheriffs-have-outsized-power-in-the-u-s](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/25/895423249/do-elected-sheriffs-have-outsized-power-in-the-u-s)

>

Sheriffs hold a host of powers, from overseeing jails, transporting prisoners and pre-trial detainees, and acting as coroners in addition to all of the normal powers associated with law enforcement officers like investigating, making arrests, serving warrants, etc.

“Despite their broad duties, sheriffs and their deputies aren’t always trained in law enforcement. Elected sheriffs may have backgrounds in business or real estate instead. Patronage can run strong in sheriffs’ departments, with some deputies hired as political favors.” [https://theappeal.org/the-power-of-sheriffs-an-explainer/](https://theappeal.org/the-power-of-sheriffs-an-explainer/)

**A staggering 60% of sheriffs run unopposed.** There’s a reason that thrillers like Jack Reacher often have a corrupt sheriff as an antagonist. Because the system is ripe for abuse and has been abused throughout the history of the United States. It is an incredible amount of power given to an elected official that has very little oversight or accountability. Of course it’s going to be abused.

It’s hard to find specific data but in many states sheriff deputies are not required by law **to have any formal training, like attending the police academy** before they’re given a badge, a gun, and are allowed to carry out law enforcement duties. “Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler apologized to members of a state board that enforces law enforcement training standards for allowing two of his appointees to participate in an  raid without proper certification, saying he didn't know they weren't qualified.” [https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2025/02/18/knox-county-sheriff-spangler-apologizes-uncertified-appointees--raids-jerry-glenn-eric-edlin/78620397007/](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2025/02/18/knox-county-sheriff-spangler-apologizes-uncertified-appointees--raids-jerry-glenn-eric-edlin/78620397007/)

# Sheriff’s Posse’s Aren’t Just Wild West Trope, They Are a Reality in 2025

In rural Klickitat County, Sheriff Bob Songer — who has drawn national attention for his belief that sheriffs have the constitutional authority to decide which laws they will enforce — **has been building a posse of volunteers nearly 10 times larger than the number of deputies**, InvestigateWest’s Paul Kiefer reported. **The posse is accountable to Songer alone, and he has warned that if the federal or state government tried to confiscate civilian firearms, he would use the posse to fight back.** The posse has drawn concerns from residents worried about Songer’s association with far-right movements, as well as the potential liability to the county in the event of a violent encounter between a posse member and a citizen. [https://www.investigatewest.org/news/a-controversial-sheriffs-posse-an-uninvestigated-disappearance-and-a-wealth-of-obstacles-to-public-records-a-year-of-investigative-report-17757349](https://www.investigatewest.org/news/a-controversial-sheriffs-posse-an-uninvestigated-disappearance-and-a-wealth-of-obstacles-to-public-records-a-year-of-investigative-report-17757349)

Songer is a  figure in the “constitutional sheriffs” movement, founded on the theory that county sheriffs have the authority to decide which state or federal laws they can enforce. He cemented his place in that movement — drawing national attention in the process — by publicly refusing to enforce gun control laws and pandemic-era public health rules. If federal or state authorities attempted to confiscate civilian firearms on his turf, Songer has warned that he would call upon the posse to help him fight back — a hypothetical showdown he once compared to the Bundy family standoffs in Nevada and  a decade ago.

**“I would call upon the citizens of the county, not just the posse, and I would deputize them,” he told InvestigateWest. “We would resist if they come in and take guns away from good citizens.”** [https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2024/10/20/sheriff-in-washington-state-has-growing-volunteer-posse-at-command/75724149007/](https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2024/10/20/sheriff-in-washington-state-has-growing-volunteer-posse-at-command/75724149007/)

Elsewhere, sheriffs have occasionally used posses for explicitly political purposes. In Culpeper County, Virginia, [federal prosecutors indicted](https://boltsmag.org/culpeper-virginia-sheriff/) a constitutional sheriff for allegedly accepting $70,000 in campaign contributions between 2019 and 2023 in exchange for making donors part of his volunteer auxiliary and providing access to firearms. **In Arizona, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s so-called “Cold Case Posse” attracted** [**attention**](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2016/11/12/maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio-heads-exit-posse-obama-birther-probe-remain-mystery/93212380/) **in 2011 when its members began investigating the validity of then-President Barack Obama’s birth certificate.

Another branch of Maricopa County’s posse — **which once boasted as many as 3,000 members — took part in Arpaio’s trademark hunt for undocumented immigrants, including participating in traffic stops, worksite raids and crowd control operations.** Those posse activities factored into a [costly](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-05-21/taxpayer-costs-for-profiling-verdict-over-joe-arpaios-immigration-crackdowns-to-reach-314m) racial discrimination lawsuit in 2012 that played a key role in transforming Arizona into a [battleground state](https://www.hcn.org/articles/books-how-activists-fought-joe-arpaios-immigration-roundups/).

The most obvious opportunity for the posse to act as enforcers for Songer’s political beliefs came during two **Black Lives Matter protests in Klickitat County in 2020 — one in White Salmon, and another in nearby Lyle. Songer routinely refers to the Black Lives Matter movement as a source of “domestic terrorism,” and he told InvestigateWest that he deployed  posse members to “keep an eye” on the protests and intervene in the event of rioting.**

Indeed, Washington law provides practically no framework for volunteer sheriff’s posses. [State statutes](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28.010) allow sheriffs to call upon civilians to help respond to riots, search for fugitives or serve civil court documents, but leave the details to the sheriffs themselves.

# Sheriff’s Have Broad Powers to Deputize ANYONE

The laws vary from state to state but sheriff’s have broad powers to deputize.

>

So imagine this hypothetical scenario. The trump regime has stated that they want to detain 12 million “illegal immigrants.” Currently ICE only has 50,000 officers. They simply don’t have the manpower to carry out their stated goal.

There’s no way they can hire on the hundreds of thousands of officers they’d need to accomplish their goal to ICE. Federal law enforcement have strict hiring standards and the pipeline to go from application to boots on the ground working for ICE is two to three years.

They need a different scheme and to leverage infrastructure and laws that are already in place. This regime is great at finding obscure laws to legitimize their otherwise illegal and unconstitutional schemes, like using the Alien Enemies act to deport immigrants without due process. This scheme using 287(g) to bring local law enforcement and especially sheriffs departments under the control of ICE is devious and it is legal.

These constitutional sheriffs can then use their existing posses, and create new posses and deputize random civilians. Everyone in this chain of command has legal law enforcement authority because they’ve been deputized by the sheriffs. And everyone has legal authority to enforce immigration law because they’ve been deputized by ICE under 287(g). They will have the legal authority to “enforce immigration policy,” aka detain people with too much melanin in their skin.

# This Isn’t Fearmongering, Mercenary Contractor Blackwater was Deputized in Katrina

About 150 heavily  Blackwater troops dressed in full battle gear spread out into the chaos of New Orleans. Officially, the company boasted of its forces ""join\[ing\] the hurricane relief effort."" But its men on the ground told a different story.

In an hourlong conversation I had with four Blackwater men, they characterized their work in New Orleans as **""securing neighborhoods"" and ""confronting criminals.""** They all carried automatic assault weapons and had guns strapped to their legs. Their flak jackets were covered with pouches for extra ammunition.

When asked what authority they were operating under, one guy said, **""We're on contract with the Department of Homeland Security.""** Then, pointing to one of his comrades, he said, ""He was even deputized by the governor of the state of Louisiana. We can make arrests and use lethal force if we deem it necessary."" The man then held up the gold **Louisiana law enforcement badge he wore around his neck.** **Blackwater spokesperson Anne Duke also said the company has a letter from Louisiana officials authorizing its forces to carry loaded weapons.**

Blackwater is not alone. As business leaders and government officials talk openly of changing the demographics of what was one of the most culturally vibrant of America's cities, mercenaries from companies like **DynCorp, Intercon, American Security Group, Blackhawk, Wackenhut and an Israeli company called Instinctive Shooting International (ISI) are fanning out to guard private businesses and homes, as well as government projects and institutions.** Within two weeks of the hurricane, the number of private security companies registered in Louisiana jumped from 185 to 235. Some, like Blackwater, are under federal contract. Others have been hired by the wealthy elite, like F. Patrick Quinn III, who brought in private security to guard his $3 million private estate and his luxury hotels, which are under consideration for a lucrative federal contract to house FEMA workers.

A possibly deadly incident involving Quinn's hired guns underscores the dangers of private forces policing American streets. On his second night in New Orleans, Quinn's security chief, Michael Montgomery, who said he worked for an Alabama company called Bodyguard and Tactical Security (BATS), was with a heavily  security detail en route to pick up one of Quinn's associates and escort him through the chaotic city. Montgomery told me they came under fire from ""black gangbangers"" on an overpass near the poor Ninth Ward neighborhood. ""At the time, I was on the phone with my business partner,"" he recalls. ""I dropped the phone and returned fire.""

Montgomery says he and his men were  with AR-15s and Glocks and that they unleashed a barrage of bullets in the general direction of the alleged shooters on the overpass. **""After that, all I heard was moaning and screaming, and the shooting stopped. That was it. Enough said.""** [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackwater-down/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackwater-down/)

# This is trump’s Paramilitary Brownshirt Army

Del Norte Sheriff Garrett Scott has announced **Merced County Sheriff's Posse** will be participating and **leading the parade on the Inauguration on President Donald J. Trump.**

Merced County Sheriff Vern Wernke released this amazing news and acknowledged Sheriff Scott and the **Del Norte County Sheriff's Posse** will be helping with financial donations. Merced County Sheriff's Posse is setting up its mounted posse unit, expediently. Funds are sought for horse feed and shelter for the Merced team.

This is not the first Rodeo for the Merced Posse. The Posse participated in President Trumps first Inauguration in 2017 and were in fact the only representatives from the Golden State for this historical event. [https://www.triplicate.com/news/merced-county-sheriffs-posse-to-lead-the-inauguration-of-president-elect-trump/article\_4b905186-c932-11ef-b87f-07bb639787c8.html](https://www.triplicate.com/news/merced-county-sheriffs-posse-to-lead-the-inauguration-of-president-elect-trump/article_4b905186-c932-11ef-b87f-07bb639787c8.html)

That’s right. A sheriff’s posse lead the parade for the trump inauguration. I would bet my life savings that most people reading this article have never heard the word sheriff posse and trump in the same sentence. I bet most of you didn’t know that sheriff posse’s were still a thing in 2025. I certainly didn’t until I started doing this research.

Remember, it’s the silent pieces that should alarm you.

The trump’s regime is clearly aware of the existence of these posse’s. They had them lead their little inauguration parade.

# Connecting the Dots

287(g) creates a command and control structure that allows ICE to oversee all of these disparate local law enforcement agencies. It centralizes the power of local law enforcement agencies in the federal government. Centralizing the power of local law enforcement behind the federal government, something these constitutional sheriffs and other anti-government, anti-fed libertarian types have been warning against for decades.

>

Turns out that the virulent racism that runs through the veins of these sheriffs win out over their fear of federal government overreach. Turns out that it was never about protecting the constitution. Turns out that their issue with the federal government all along was with the person in charge(a black man named Barack Obama). This entire movement sprung up under the Obama presidency and has now been given legitimacy under trump.

# The Blueprint for the Brownshirt Paramilitary

* 287(g) allows the trump regime to control and give broad immigration enforcement powers to local law enforcement agencies
* 287(g) gives the federal government streamlined communications and cooperation with local law enforcement agencies. It creates a chain of command, in other words it creates a command and control structure for the federal government to direct the actions of local LEOs.
* “Constitutional Sheriffs” have already established posses who have already participated in intimidating Black Lives Matter protestors and performed  “immigration enforcement” patrols along the southern border.
* Sheriffs have the broad power to deputize anyone they want, giving legal authority to carry firearms and perform law enforcement duties including the use of deadly force.
* These posses have **already carried out immigration enforcement activities in Arizona.** “Another branch of Maricopa County’s posse — which once boasted as many as 3,000 members — took part in Arpaio’s trademark hunt for undocumented immigrants, including participating in traffic stops, worksite raids and crowd control operations.”
* Deputizing , non-LEO citizens and giving them the authority to use deadly force is not unprecedented. The federal government deputized Blackwater, a private military mercenary group during hurricane Katrina and gave them broad powers to carry weapons and use deadly force. Eric Prince, the founder of Blackwater, has submitted a $25 billion proposal to create a “private Army” to round up “illegal immigrants.” [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/military-contractors-prison-plan-detained-immigrants-erik-prince-00287208](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/military-contractors-prison-plan-detained-immigrants-erik-prince-00287208)
* Sheriffs will gather posses, deputize civilians and grant broad legal powers. This is my own speculation but I believe they will likely tap white supremacy militias and the like for their posses. This will form the backbone of the new brownshirt paramilitary army.
* Mercenary contractor groups will be deputized under this scheme to give more teeth to the organizations. Many of these mercenary contractors are former US military and special operations.

I believe we are already seeing this in action. The videos showing completely untrained, unfit, ununiformed, masked men who fail to identify themselves is an indicator that this is already happening. My speculation is that ICE is using contractors, like G4S, and sending out one real agent to lead a gang of these contractors on raids. The contractors are the hired muscle and the real federal agent brings legitimacy and command and control.

This will be their model across the US. Their posse and deputized white supremacists will be the muscle, lead by actual trained law enforcement. They will be used to enact violence against the regime’s political enemies and carry out their brutal detention of millions of immigrants. And if you think it only stops at “illegal immigrants” you are ignoring the history of every damn authoritarian regime.

Mercenary contractors, like Blackwater(now Constellis Holdings), will perform more specialized raids on the homes of politicians, journalists, intellectuals, and activists. They will be used to kidnap and disappear prominent leaders in the resistance against the regime. Of course these folks will have trumped up charges of aiding and abetting terrorists and whatever else laid upon them to give the veneer of legality.

And folks this will all be perfectly legal under our current laws.

***Xander Ridgeford, Straider General***

*December 5th, Earth year 2103*

*Dreadnought.* With how often the term is thrown around, it’s easy to forget where it came from. Dread nought—‘fear nothing’. Standing aboard one of these top-of-the-line leviathans, I can confirm that they live up to the title. 

Meg was the pride of our fleet: clunky? Sure. Cutting-edge? Hardly. But she had teeth befitting her namesake and had pulled us through more hellstorms than I cared to count. These Inzar models, though—voted names ‘Rex’ and ‘Quetzal’—were more than that. They were *cities*. Mobile, heavily-armed cities well over three times the size of our original dreadnought. 

Reading out the specs of these models, I had to go over them multiple times just to believe the words coming out of my own damn mouth. Of course, it was one thing to read about these features listed on a screen. If I really wanted a feel for these ships, I’d have to see it all for myself.

Gathering together my lieutenants, I piled us all into a transport vessel and typed in the necessary commands for it to bring us into the Rex. “Are you sure you trust this ‘Dovetail’ person?” Probed Eddy, looking upon me with skepticism as one of our new Dreadnought’s docking bays opened up to allow us inside. “I mean, look at the size of these things! There’s no way they snuck them out without the Council knowing.”

*“The galaxy is a big place,”* Replied Dovetail’s voice from a speaker on the transport, startling everyone save for Avery and I. *“You’d be surprised what can get lost out here.”*

“How the hell?” Hugo growled, concern visible on his face. “Xander, how much access did you give to… *Dovetail*?”

*“None,”* the speaker responded in my place, their geometric avatar showing up onscreen as though to look us in the face. *“I can break through firewalls as easily as one of you can kick down a door. Fortunately for you, we are on the same side.”*

Seeing that this did nothing to alleviate the concerns of my underlings, I turned my seat around to face them directly. “At ease, people: Dovetail is an ally… For now at least.”

*“Thank you for that vaguely threatening* explanation\*, Xander,”\* Dovetail replied, sounding almost amused by our conversation. *“Of course, when you all see the inside of this vessel, I get the feeling you’ll trust me just a little bit more.”*

A few minutes later, our shuttle rattled into place upon a landing pad within the hangar, and we all stepped out. The difference between this vessel and our old one was obvious not even at a glance, but a *breath*. The air on the Megalodon was stale and smelled vaguely of rust. Here on Rex, though, the air was crisp and clean—the kind you only get from the real expensive filters.

“Smells like Earth…” Avery noted, taking in a deep breath as though she had been drowning for the past twenty years. “Or at least what I remember it smelling like.”

First impressions mattered, and this ship made one hell of a sales pitch on us. Sparkling white floors squeaked slightly beneath our worn boots as we made our way to the high speed in-ship tram system. “First things first…” I murmured, pressing down on the button labeled ‘bridge’. Within what couldn’t have been longer than a minute, the tram doors opened back up and we stepped out into the vessel’s nerve center. 

“My god…” Dwight gasped, running his fingers along the chrome side of a top-of-the-line holographic display table depicting Rex's myriad weapon systems. “Antimatter missiles, relativistic railguns, and… Is that an RKV bay?”

If those weapons were meant to fight a battle, the interfaces that guided them were meant to win a war. AI targeting assistance, experimental neural weapon interfaces, simulation tech that could tell you how a battle would end before you fired the first shot. 

“These shields…” Began Peraq, reverently running his claws along the hologram like a priest polishing their religion’s most holy relic. “These are Saharkhi plasma triweave—the best non-confidential prototypes of it are fifty years from usable. This thing can shrug off a nuclear bomb like a spitball.”

*“Or survive within a star for nearly half an hour,”* Dovetail chimed in, their voice projecting from every speaker on the ship as though they were a god addressing their disciples.

“What even *are* these ships?” Hugo growled, staring down one of the screens displaying Dovetail’s avatar. “I’ve never even heard of half of these weapon systems!”

After being glared at for a few seconds, Dovetail emitted a sound resembling a sigh before once again speaking up. *“Project Andromeda is a Council contingency plan. In essence, with only a tenth of the galaxy properly explored, the odds of external threats existing that could challenge them has been estimated conservatively at 68%. In order to preserve their civilization in the event of a catastrophe, the Council is constructing thousands of these vessels. Worst-case scenario, they are designed to keep the populations within safe while ferrying them to the Andromeda galaxy—a journey that would take generations.”*

“And you’re saying they have *thousands* of these things?” Avery half-whispered, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and terror.

*“Fortunately, no,”* our benefactor replied, pulling up a holographic diagram depicting the two vessels gifted to us. *“These ships are merely working prototypes of the final design. Council scientists are still in the process of perfecting this model for intergalactic travel. Originally, these two were going to be recycled, but with a few credits in the right hands and some sympathetic hands on the inside, I was able to get them marked as ‘nonfunctional’ and ‘too dangerous to dismantle’—a combination which led to them being spaced instead. From there, it was a simple matter of outfitting them at black market ports and sending the toys your way.”*

Meanwhile, in the center of dozens of holographic displays sat a captain’s chair that to my eyes more resembled a throne. Approaching it with hesitant steps, there was a small part of me that felt like I was supposed to be kneeling. However, this chair wasn’t demanding that I kneel—it was beckoning me to *sit*. 

Of course, before I could truly claim that throne, I had to know more about the vessel I’d be king of. “Color me impressed,” I chuckled, turning back around to see my lieutenants all taking stock of the weapon systems. “What else has she got?”

In response, the tram door opened back up, and Dovetail’s voice came on inside as though they were waiting there for us. *“Allow me to give you a guided tour.”*

Stepping back into the tram, nobody needed to press a button for it to once again start moving, carrying us away from the ship’s brain and down into the body that would sustain it. When the doors opened back up, none of us could believe what we were seeing. Lining the sides of a promenade as wide as an airport corridor were rows upon rows of massive, multi-story installations. Approaching the nearest one and navigating to its first room, I saw Hugo’s jaw damn-near hit the floor as we opened the door and found ourselves within a small living room complete with a mounted flatscreen. “These aren’t just living spaces: they’re fucking apartments!”

Back on the Megalodon, it was all I could do to make sure everyone had a cot to sleep on and access to a communal shower. Taking a look around this living space, it was all I could do not to gawk at its comparative decadence. The bedroom had an *actual* bed, fresh-scented white towels laid in a tidy stack within the private bathroom, and the kitchen came pre-stocked with non-perishable goods. *“Each of these habitation spaces is intended for one person, but can easily accommodate three or four should the need arise,”* Dovetail practically gloated. *“There are, of course, larger dorms meant for couples and families.”*

Moving on down the promenade, whispers of anxiety and excitement bounced between my crew as we surveyed the civilization in a can we’d just been handed. 

Our next destination was what Dovetail referred to as the ‘productivity zone’. Asteroid mining bays already harboring metallic riches waited in silence with top of the line tools at the ready to help us exploit the starbound bounty. “No more scrounging for scraps…” Added Avery, her words hanging in the air as she ran her fingers along the rough, rocky surface of an asteroid.

Then came the factories—*plural*. Row upon row of assembly lines erupted to life as we walked in, miming their usual tasks in a mechanical salute to us. “Look at this interface!” Peraq chittered, visibly blown away. “With these, we can produce anything we need! Guns, ship parts, prosthetics, civilian products.”

“What exactly powers all this?” Hugo growled, his question beating the register of a challenge to Dovetail. 

*“There are three cold fusion reactors onboard this vessel and its twin. Only one is required to maintain all of the essential functions—keeping the factories running and the pool warm. The other two are largely backups, though their power can be instantaneously routed anywhere throughout the ship—”*

“There’s a goddamn pool!” Eddy practically shouted, his former doubts seemingly dead in the water as Dovetail guided us into the recreational sector. The smell of chlorinated water greeted us like an old friend as we stepped into the massive swimming chamber. Warm, simulated sunlight shone down from the ceiling, glistening off the legion of white lounge chairs waiting poolside. 

Slowly approaching the water’s edge, Dwight stared down at his reflection in its still, glassy surface. “The last time I swam I was crossing a muddy lake to escape animal control.”

Before anyone could stop him and without removing his uniform, Eddy sprinted toward the water’s edge and cannonballed in. In attempting to shove Dwight aside, however, he instead wound up taking my weapons tech into the water with him. It was the first time in years—maybe ever—I’d ever heard Avery lose her mind laughing. Given that this was a big moment, I decided against chewing out my propagandist for this lack of decorum. 

Then came the bars—because of course this damned ship would have two of them. The first one we entered had a high-class air to it. Fine imported wood and wood-analogues from across the galaxy comprised the comfortable stools and the counter already outfitted with spirits the names of which I couldn’t even pronounce. *“I made sure to have everything pre-stocked for you all,”* Dovetail began, their voice crackling through our earpiece*s. “Of course, both available bars are equipped with their own breweries.”*

“Of course the Council needs a fancy bar on their ark ship,” Hugo growled, nevertheless retrieving a glass and holding it up to one of the lined up taps out of morbid curiosity. Even he, however, could barely maintain his scornful expression when a stream of golden-brown beer poured itself out for him. 

For what it was worth, the second bar was much more Hugo and my style—complete with dart boards, a pool table, and arcade machines. “Oh, this place is gonna be popular,” I chuckled, watching as Eddy and Dwight went at each other in a game of ping-pong. “Gotta say, Dovetail: you outdid yourself.”

*“Better than the Old Guard, I trust?”* Our new benefactor snarked, their knowledge of our other contact startling me, though I tried to hide it.

“This is all well and good,” Hugo interjected, his tone suggesting that everything was in fact not well and good, “but how exactly are we supposed to keep a bar stocked? We’re not even self-sufficient with fucking nutrient paste!”

*“You’re going to like this next one,”* Dovetail replied, waiting for us all to take our leave before guiding us back to the tram and selecting a button I hadn’t even read the label of. ‘Hydroponics bay’.

As the tram silently whistled to a stop and its doors opened up to show us the other side, we were greeted not by a hallway, but a horizon. Humid, earthy air rushed to greet us, rich with the scent of chlorophyll and fresh soil. What lay beyond us looked less like something you’d find in a warship and more like a valley cracked open beneath an artificial sky. Tiered layers of farmland stretched out above and below us, lit by massive sunlamps perfectly portraying a gentle spring morning. 

“Holy shit…” Eddy and Avery breathed practically in unison. 

Each of the four layers stretched two miles in either direction, partitioned by near irrigation channels and flanked by cobblestone walkways. Without a word, we walked as if in a trance through the median layer, passing by fields of wheat that waved us forth and corn that stood at attention. As we navigated further to the back, the scents grew stronger and more exotic. Mint and cilantro grew up against the walls alongside groves of trees that sagged with fruit—apples, oranges, mangoes. Coffee beans and cotton grew in neighboring patches, their presence a silent promise of warm clothes and a steaming morning brew. 

Peraq chittered with reverent disbelief, gently taking a peach into his clutches. “This kind of acreage could feed tens—no, hundreds of thousands!”

*“The top three layers are for crops,”* explained Dovetail, their voice coming on over a PA system that echoed all throughout the artificial farmland. *“The bottom level is specialized for livestock. There are chicken embryos ready to incubate within the lab two floors up. I also went ahead and genetically modified some bees for optimal honey production. They don’t sting, of course!”*

Then, Hugo stopped walking. Turning my gaze to follow his own, I saw that my sheriff was staring at a patch of vivid red just off the path—strawberries, fat and ripe and crawling over their planter bed as though begging someone to try them. 

Without a word, he stepped off the path, knelt down, and picked one. The rest of us watched in silence as he turned it over in his calloused palm, his fingers trembling slightly—just for a moment—before he bit in. 

There was a crunch. Then silence. Then, very slowly, Hugo turned away from us. I saw his shoulders grow tense.

“Hugo?” I asked, approaching him cautiously.

Back still turned to me, Hugo shook his head. “It’s nothing,” he murmured. “I just haven’t had a real strawberry since I was nine.”

When he turned back around to face us, nobody questioned the redness in his eyes. Dwight for what it was worth was too busy searching for the brightest piece of fruit to bite into. 

“Avery,” I called out to my second in command. “Once we’re back on the bridge, I want you to get to work resettling civilians onto these ships. Everyone else: promote your best underling—we’re going to need to staff these two behemoths. And Dwight?”

The weapons tech turned around to face me, wiping a smear of red juice from his face. “Yes sir?” He asked.

“I need you to make sure Rex's weapon systems are prepared. The Jakuvian homeworld is heavily-guarded, and our new friend needs us to give ‘em hell.”",Maxton1811,HFY,Neutral,Gun Control,"Denied Sapience 18 [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i2lapr/denied_sapience/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)...[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kujjw7/denied_sapience_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Tiered layers of farmland stretched out above and below us, lit by massive sunlamps perfectly portraying a gentle spring morning. 

“Holy shit…” Eddy and Avery breathed practically in unison. 

Each of the four layers stretched two miles in either direction, partitioned by near irrigation channels and flanked by cobblestone walkways. Without a word, we walked as if in a trance through the median layer, passing by fields of wheat that waved us forth and corn that stood at attention. As we navigated further to the back, the scents grew stronger and more exotic. Mint and cilantro grew up against the walls alongside groves of trees that sagged with fruit—apples, oranges, mangoes. Coffee beans and cotton grew in neighboring patches, their presence a silent promise of warm clothes and a steaming morning brew. 

Peraq chittered with reverent disbelief, gently taking a peach into his clutches. “This kind of acreage could feed tens—no, hundreds of thousands!”

*“The top three layers are for crops,”* explained Dovetail, their voice coming on over a PA system that echoed all throughout the artificial farmland. *“The bottom level is specialized for livestock. There are chicken embryos ready to incubate within the lab two floors up. I also went ahead and genetically modified some bees for optimal honey production. They don’t sting, of course!”*

Then, Hugo stopped walking. Turning my gaze to follow his own, I saw that my sheriff was staring at a patch of vivid red just off the path—strawberries, fat and ripe and crawling over their planter bed as though begging someone to try them. 

Without a word, he stepped off the path, knelt down, and picked one. The rest of us watched in silence as he turned it over in his calloused palm, his fingers trembling slightly—just for a moment—before he bit in. 

There was a crunch. Then silence. Then, very slowly, Hugo turned away from us. I saw his shoulders grow tense.

“Hugo?” I asked, approaching him cautiously.

Back still turned to me, Hugo shook his head. “It’s nothing,” he murmured. “I just haven’t had a real strawberry since I was nine.”

When he turned back around to face us, nobody questioned the redness in his eyes. Dwight for what it was worth was too busy searching for the brightest piece of fruit to bite into. 

“Avery,” I called out to my second in command. “Once we’re back on the bridge, I want you to get to work resettling civilians onto these ships. Everyone else: promote your best underling—we’re going to need to staff these two behemoths. And Dwight?”

The weapons tech turned around to face me, wiping a smear of red juice from his face. “Yes sir?” He asked.

***Xander Ridgeford, Straider General***

*December 5th, Earth year 2103*

*Dreadnought.* With how often the term is thrown around, it’s easy to forget where it came from. Dread nought—‘fear nothing’. Standing aboard one of these top-of-the-line leviathans, I can confirm that they live up to the title. 

Meg was the  of our fleet: clunky? Sure. Cutting-edge? Hardly. But she had teeth befitting her namesake and had pulled us through more hellstorms than I cared to count. These Inzar models, though—voted names ‘Rex’ and ‘Quetzal’—were more than that. They were *cities*. Mobile, heavily- cities well over three times the size of our original dreadnought. 

Reading out the specs of these models, I had to go over them multiple times just to believe the words coming out of my own damn mouth. Of course, it was one thing to read about these features listed on a screen. If I really wanted a feel for these ships, I’d have to see it all for myself.

Gathering together my lieutenants, I piled us all into a transport vessel and typed in the necessary commands for it to bring us into the Rex. “Are you sure you trust this ‘Dovetail’ person?” Probed Eddy, looking upon me with skepticism as one of our new Dreadnought’s docking bays opened up to allow us inside. “I mean, look at the size of these things! There’s no way they snuck them out without the Council knowing.”

*“The galaxy is a big place,”* Replied Dovetail’s voice from a speaker on the transport, startling everyone save for Avery and I. *“You’d be surprised what can get lost out here.”*

“How the hell?” Hugo growled, concern visible on his face. “Xander, how much access did you give to… *Dovetail*?”

*“None,”* the speaker responded in my place, their geometric avatar showing up onscreen as though to look us in the face. *“I can break through firewalls as easily as one of you can kick down a door. Fortunately for you, we are on the same side.”*

Seeing that this did nothing to alleviate the concerns of my underlings, I turned my seat around to face them directly. “At ease, people: Dovetail is an ally… For now at least.”

*“Thank you for that vaguely threatening* explanation\*, Xander,”\* Dovetail replied, sounding almost amused by our conversation. *“Of course, when you all see the inside of this vessel, I get the feeling you’ll trust me just a little bit more.”*

A few minutes later, our shuttle rattled into place upon a landing pad within the hangar, and we all stepped out. The difference between this vessel and our old one was obvious not even at a glance, but a *breath*. The air on the Megalodon was stale and smelled vaguely of rust. Here on Rex, though, the air was crisp and clean—the kind you only get from the real expensive filters.

“Smells like Earth…” Avery noted, taking in a deep breath as though she had been drowning for the past twenty years. “Or at least what I remember it smelling like.”

First impressions mattered, and this ship made one hell of a sales pitch on us. Sparkling white floors squeaked slightly beneath our worn boots as we made our way to the high speed in-ship tram system. “First things first…” I murmured, pressing down on the button labeled ‘bridge’. Within what couldn’t have been longer than a minute, the tram doors opened back up and we stepped out into the vessel’s nerve center. 

“My god…” Dwight gasped, running his fingers along the chrome side of a top-of-the-line holographic display table depicting Rex's myriad weapon systems. “Antimatter missiles, relativistic railguns, and… Is that an RKV bay?”

If those weapons were meant to fight a battle, the interfaces that guided them were meant to win a war. AI targeting assistance, experimental neural weapon interfaces, simulation tech that could tell you how a battle would end before you fired the first shot. 

“These shields…” Began Peraq, reverently running his claws along the hologram like a priest polishing their religion’s most holy relic. “These are Saharkhi plasma triweave—the best non-confidential prototypes of it are fifty years from usable. This thing can shrug off a nuclear bomb like a spitball.”

*“Or survive within a star for nearly half an hour,”* Dovetail chimed in, their voice projecting from every speaker on the ship as though they were a god addressing their disciples.

“What even *are* these ships?” Hugo growled, staring down one of the screens displaying Dovetail’s avatar. “I’ve never even heard of half of these weapon systems!”

After being glared at for a few seconds, Dovetail emitted a sound resembling a sigh before once again speaking up. *“Project Andromeda is a Council contingency plan. In essence, with only a tenth of the galaxy properly explored, the odds of external threats existing that could challenge them has been estimated conservatively at 68%. In order to preserve their civilization in the event of a catastrophe, the Council is constructing thousands of these vessels. Worst-case scenario, they are designed to keep the populations within safe while ferrying them to the Andromeda galaxy—a journey that would take generations.”*

“And you’re saying they have *thousands* of these things?” Avery half-whispered, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and terror.

*“Fortunately, no,”* our benefactor replied, pulling up a holographic diagram depicting the two vessels gifted to us. *“These ships are merely working prototypes of the final design. Council scientists are still in the process of perfecting this model for intergalactic travel. Originally, these two were going to be recycled, but with a few credits in the right hands and some sympathetic hands on the inside, I was able to get them marked as ‘nonfunctional’ and ‘too dangerous to dismantle’—a combination which led to them being spaced instead. From there, it was a simple matter of outfitting them at black market ports and sending the toys your way.”*

Meanwhile, in the center of dozens of holographic displays sat a captain’s chair that to my eyes more resembled a throne. Approaching it with hesitant steps, there was a small part of me that felt like I was supposed to be kneeling. However, this chair wasn’t demanding that I kneel—it was beckoning me to *sit*. 

Of course, before I could truly claim that throne, I had to know more about the vessel I’d be king of. “Color me impressed,” I chuckled, turning back around to see my lieutenants all taking stock of the weapon systems. “What else has she got?”

In response, the tram door opened back up, and Dovetail’s voice came on inside as though they were waiting there for us. *“Allow me to give you a guided tour.”*

Stepping back into the tram, nobody needed to press a button for it to once again start moving, carrying us away from the ship’s brain and down into the body that would sustain it. When the doors opened back up, none of us could believe what we were seeing. Lining the sides of a promenade as wide as an airport corridor were rows upon rows of massive, multi-story installations. Approaching the nearest one and navigating to its first room, I  Hugo’s jaw damn-near hit the floor as we opened the door and found ourselves within a small living room complete with a mounted flatscreen. “These aren’t just living spaces: they’re fucking apartments!”

Back on the Megalodon, it was all I could do to make sure everyone had a cot to sleep on and access to a communal shower. Taking a look around this living space, it was all I could do not to gawk at its comparative decadence. The bedroom had an *actual* bed, fresh-scented white towels laid in a tidy stack within the private bathroom, and the kitchen came pre-stocked with non-perishable goods. *“Each of these habitation spaces is intended for one person, but can easily accommodate three or four should the need arise,”* Dovetail practically gloated. *“There are, of course, larger dorms meant for couples and families.”*

Moving on down the promenade, whispers of anxiety and excitement bounced between my crew as we surveyed the civilization in a can we’d just been handed. 

Our next destination was what Dovetail referred to as the ‘productivity zone’. Asteroid mining bays already harboring metallic riches waited in silence with top of the line tools at the ready to help us exploit the starbound bounty. “No more scrounging for scraps…” Added Avery, her words hanging in the air as she ran her fingers along the rough, rocky surface of an asteroid.

Then came the factories—*plural*. Row upon row of assembly lines erupted to life as we walked in, miming their usual tasks in a mechanical salute to us. “Look at this interface!” Peraq chittered, visibly blown away. “With these, we can produce anything we need! Guns, ship parts, prosthetics, civilian products.”

“What exactly powers all this?” Hugo growled, his question beating the register of a challenge to Dovetail. 

*“There are three cold fusion reactors onboard this vessel and its twin. Only one is required to maintain all of the essential functions—keeping the factories running and the pool warm. The other two are largely backups, though their power can be instantaneously routed anywhere throughout the ship—”*

“There’s a goddamn pool!” Eddy practically shouted, his former doubts seemingly dead in the water as Dovetail guided us into the recreational sector. The smell of chlorinated water greeted us like an old friend as we stepped into the massive swimming chamber. Warm, simulated sunlight shone down from the ceiling, glistening off the legion of white lounge chairs waiting poolside. 

Slowly approaching the water’s edge, Dwight stared down at his reflection in its still, glassy surface. “The last time I swam I was crossing a muddy lake to escape animal control.”

Before anyone could stop him and without removing his uniform, Eddy sprinted toward the water’s edge and cannonballed in. In attempting to shove Dwight aside, however, he instead wound up taking my weapons tech into the water with him. It was the first time in years—maybe ever—I’d ever heard Avery lose her mind laughing. Given that this was a big moment, I decided against chewing out my propagandist for this lack of decorum. 

Then came the bars—because of course this damned ship would have two of them. The first one we entered had a high-class air to it. Fine imported wood and wood-analogues from across the galaxy comprised the comfortable stools and the counter already outfitted with spirits the names of which I couldn’t even pronounce. *“I made sure to have everything pre-stocked for you all,”* Dovetail began, their voice crackling through our earpiece*s. “Of course, both available bars are equipped with their own breweries.”*

“Of course the Council needs a fancy bar on their ark ship,” Hugo growled, nevertheless retrieving a glass and holding it up to one of the lined up taps out of morbid curiosity. Even he, however, could barely maintain his scornful expression when a stream of golden-brown beer poured itself out for him. 

For what it was worth, the second bar was much more Hugo and my style—complete with dart boards, a pool table, and arcade machines. “Oh, this place is gonna be popular,” I chuckled, watching as Eddy and Dwight went at each other in a game of ping-pong. “Gotta say, Dovetail: you outdid yourself.”

*“Better than the Old Guard, I trust?”* Our new benefactor snarked, their knowledge of our other contact startling me, though I tried to hide it.

“This is all well and good,” Hugo interjected, his tone suggesting that everything was in fact not well and good, “but how exactly are we supposed to keep a bar stocked? We’re not even self-sufficient with fucking nutrient paste!”

*“You’re going to like this next one,”* Dovetail replied, waiting for us all to take our leave before guiding us back to the tram and selecting a button I hadn’t even read the label of. ‘Hydroponics bay’.

As the tram silently whistled to a stop and its doors opened up to show us the other side, we were greeted not by a hallway, but a horizon. Humid, earthy air rushed to greet us, rich with the scent of chlorophyll and fresh soil. What lay beyond us looked less like something you’d find in a warship and more like a valley cracked open beneath an artificial sky. Tiered layers of farmland stretched out above and below us, lit by massive sunlamps perfectly portraying a gentle spring morning. 

“Holy shit…” Eddy and Avery breathed practically in unison. 

Each of the four layers stretched two miles in either direction, partitioned by near irrigation channels and flanked by cobblestone walkways. Without a word, we walked as if in a trance through the median layer, passing by fields of wheat that waved us forth and corn that stood at attention. As we navigated further to the back, the scents grew stronger and more exotic. Mint and cilantro grew up against the walls alongside groves of trees that sagged with fruit—apples, oranges, mangoes. Coffee beans and cotton grew in neighboring patches, their presence a silent promise of warm clothes and a steaming morning brew. 

Peraq chittered with reverent disbelief, gently taking a peach into his clutches. “This kind of acreage could feed tens—no, hundreds of thousands!”

*“The top three layers are for crops,”* explained Dovetail, their voice coming on over a PA system that echoed all throughout the artificial farmland. *“The bottom level is specialized for livestock. There are chicken embryos ready to incubate within the lab two floors up. I also went ahead and genetically modified some bees for optimal honey production. They don’t sting, of course!”*

Then, Hugo stopped walking. Turning my gaze to follow his own, I  that my sheriff was staring at a patch of vivid red just off the path—strawberries, fat and ripe and crawling over their planter bed as though begging someone to try them. 

Without a word, he stepped off the path, knelt down, and picked one. The rest of us watched in silence as he turned it over in his calloused palm, his fingers trembling slightly—just for a moment—before he bit in. 

There was a crunch. Then silence. Then, very slowly, Hugo turned away from us. I  his shoulders grow tense.

“Hugo?” I asked, approaching him cautiously.

Back still turned to me, Hugo shook his head. “It’s nothing,” he murmured. “I just haven’t had a real strawberry since I was nine.”

When he turned back around to face us, nobody questioned the redness in his eyes. Dwight for what it was worth was too busy searching for the brightest piece of fruit to bite into. 

“Avery,” I called out to my second in command. “Once we’re back on the bridge, I want you to get to work resettling civilians onto these ships. Everyone else: promote your best underling—we’re going to need to staff these two behemoths. And Dwight?”

The weapons tech turned around to face me, wiping a smear of red juice from his face. “Yes sir?” He asked.

You may skip this section without losing the essence of what I'm trying to argue in this post. However, I think it is an insightful read, so if you have some time to spend on reading an already long-form post, I encourage you to stick around.

This post is an adaptation from my comments on a recent thread regarding abortion. The point of this post is to explain why pro-life advocates who make the claim:

>Consent to sex = Consent to pregnancy

have a limited understanding of the legal, ethical, logical, and linguistic fields of study/science, or are willfully ignorant. This is not to say that if you hold this opinion as a pro-life advocate, your entire pro-life stance is inherently invalid: it is not, and believing otherwise is yet another example of how pro-life advocates do not understand logic.

Arguments in real life are typically structured using something I call a *disjunctively sufficient justification,* that is, you may hold two separate talking points that are separate but support the same conclusion. For example:

>**P1:** Human life has intrinsic moral value from the moment of conception; terminating it is wrong regardless of consent.  
**P2:** Consent to sex = Consent to pregnancy, and thus, you are responsible for the pregnancy; terminating a fetus you are responsible for is wrong  
**C:** If P1 or P2 is true, termination is wrong.

In logical terms, the formula for what I wrote above is:

>**((P1→C)∧(P2→C))→((P1∨P2)→C)**

DISCLAIMER: *Yes, I know, this is a tautological statement* *(in that it is a single truth-functional statement, which is not what a formal representation would look like). A more accurate logical representation is using ⊢ instead of* ***→*** *between P1/P2 and C, and/or dropping the conjunction symbol, essentially turning it into a sequent, but the proposition alone sufficiently explains our ""perception"" of logic as it applies to real-life argumentation. This post is written in a heuristic manner and aimed towards a layperson audience. For transparency, I will repeat this point by writing other disclaimers throughout the post.*

What I'm saying is that if P1 is true even when P2 is untrue, your argument is still valid. This is how arguments typically work in real life. Modelling only P1 and P2 is disingenuous, because usually, there are many, many Ps that all build atop another both conjunctively and disjunctively in order to get to an actual take/point. However, please note that **P1** in the case above implies that terminating pregnancies that result from rape is wrong. If you don't believe that, your opinion may be structured as a *conjunctively necessary justification,* that is, the two propositions are linked by an AND operator, and disproving one statement disproves your entire argument. Here's an example:

>**P1:** Human life has intrinsic moral value from the moment of conception; ending it is only permissible when the pregnant person is not responsible for the pregnancy.  
**P2:** Consent to sex entails responsibility for the resulting pregnancy.  
**C:** If P1 and P2 are true, termination is wrong, if either or both are false, termination is not wrong.

Ok, great, you get the point. The preface was here to tell you that even if I am right, your argument as a pro-life advocate is not necessarily threatened. The point of my saying this is so you can go into this post with an open mind and accept that what I'm pointing out is, in fact, true, whether you like it or not.

DISCLAIMER: *If you are familiar with logic, you may realize that none of this is formal/rigurous at all. This is true, but vacuously so; it gets the point across to the average reader who is likely unfamiliar with logic. A more formal attempt at a proof is further down in the post, under point 2. However, again, do note that the target audience for this is the average layperson, not a logician, and this is self-evident from my post title: ""an attempt.""*

**POINT 1: The purpose of pregnancy.**

Something pro-life proponents often claim is that sex is, specifically, an evolved instinct that exists solely for the process of reproduction. The pleasure derived from sex is the byproduct, not the intention. 

But purpose is not a definitive, universal concept; it is rather a human construct meant to allow us to interpret the world. Biology describes the function of something, how it works, but *not* its purpose. Claiming this is a classic example of the is/ought fallacy:

>Reproduction is the biological function of sex, thus, sex ought to be engaged in solely for reproduction.

That is a prescriptive statement meant to logically follow from a descriptive statement, the is/ought fallacy.

To expand on the point about purpose, let me make a structurally identical claim that I'm sure you'll agree is illogical:

>Guns are a concept generated for killing people and/or animals. Using guns at a gun range is a byproduct, not the purpose of owning guns. Thus you should not own guns if you don’t want to kill people and/or animals.

This is, of course, ridiculous! Why can’t I like guns just because they’re cool? Say I buy a gun; if my intent in buying a gun is to shoot it at a shooting range, are we to assume that I’m a cold-hearted killer who wants to shoot people because ""the universe"" decided the purpose of guns is killing? Of course not.

Besides that, claiming that ""purpose is a human construct and subject to interpretation"" is not just me waxing philosophical. The purpose of marriage used to be either political or religious, and still is in many eastern cultures; in western cultures, however, it's love. The purpose of money was facilitating barter systems; nowadays, it's a million different things. The cross was a symbol of torture, now it's a religious symbol of love. The purpose of cocaine was treating disease, now it's substance abuse. The purpose of radioactive materials was making fluorescent glasses and toys, now it's nuclear energy or bombs. The purpose of body hair, eye colour, male nipples, the tailbone, the appendix, wisdom teeth is absolutely nothing biologically, yet they either had or didn't have a purpose at some point long in our ancestors' history (which goes to show that ""biological purpose"" is not the end-all-be-all).

The list can go on forever and ever. These are all things that once had a purpose that has since changed, being re-interpreted by later generations. If society as a whole can re-interpret something, can one person individually not do that for themselves? Societal movements and shifts in thought, after all, always start on the individual level. So then, if you agree with what I've said so far, is it not reasonable for a person to decide on their own what the ""purpose"" of sex is (pleasure), rather than arbitrarily deciding its purpose (reproduction) based on a consensus that benefits your political agenda?

**POINT 2: The logical argument.**

The problem with the pro-life stance is that they typically conflate these two statements as being identical:

>""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you consent to Y.""  
""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you accept the possibility of Y.""

The thing is, that belief is completely, entirely **wrong.** Demonstrably so. The easiest way to point this out is to state that statement 1 is a classic example of a modal scope fallacy, whereas statement 2 is not. However, my point in writing this post is that people don't understand the *implication* of what it means for their argument to be fallacious.

Thus, I will set out to prove this using modal logic. This is an attempt to get over the stigma of pointing out fallacies. I think lots of people see ""logical fallacies"" as funny internet quips thrown around by redditors, but by formalizing the logic behind fallacious arguments in a somewhat rigorous form, I will attempt to demonstrate how making fallacious arguments and standing by them even in the face of overwhelming proof is an active denial of science, that is, the science of logic. Making such statements and standing by them knowing they are fallacious is no different from arguing the earth is flat for all intents and purposes.

I will break down statement number one as follows:

>P1: Consent is given for action X.  
P2: Y is an outcome with any degree of probability of X.  
C: Therefore, consent to X implies consent to Y.

First, I'll first try to prove why this is completely absurd using words, then move on to the modal logic proof.

You consent to X. (P1) If X happens, there is some non-zero chance that Y will also happen. (P2) Therefore, you already consented to Y. (C)""

|Pregnancy|STI|
|:-|:-|
|**X** = “vaginal intercourse with a condom.”|**X** = “vaginal intercourse with a condom.”|
|**Y** = “pregnancy”|**Y** = ""a microscopic condom tear transmits an undetected STI such as HIV""|
|P2: “Even with a condom, pregnancy is possible.”|P2: “Even with a condom, contracting an STI is possible”|
|C: “Therefore, you already consented to pregnancy.”|C: “Therefore, you already consented to contracting an undetected STI.”|

I'm sure you can see that the moral implications of statement 1 are incredibly wrong. I tried my hardest to come up with a perfect, structurally identical example, but even the slightest tweaks in structure can create even more morally dubious claims.

For example, if we remove this structure from the concept of consent alone, you can follow the statement to argue that if a woman walks through the streets alone at night, there is a possibility of her being raped, and she thus already accepted being raped (not the possibility of it as statement 2 implies, she straight up accepted being raped by statement 1's logic). Or, using the same logical structure, you can argue that if a condom breaks during sex, they already consented to the condom breaking, but that’s absurd; the person has no control over whether the condom breaks or not. Or, again, tweaking the structure, you can argue that driving means you have already accepted dying in a car crash. Or, by adding a specific action in the mix, you can argue that stealthing is not illegal because a woman already consented to it. It's all ridiculous.

Now, moving on to the modal logic proof:

[https://www.umsu.de/trees/](https://www.umsu.de/trees/)  
This is a tree proof generator that calculates whether a formula is valid or invalid.

For the first sentence, we have: “If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you consent to Y.”

The formula I used to represent this is:

**(□X∧◇(X→Y))→□Y**

Where □ is the necessity operator as in “you consent to …”, ∧ is the ""AND"" operator, ◇ is the possibility operator, and X → Y reads “whenever X occurs, Y follows.” If you run this through the tree proof generator, it will tell you that the proposition is invalid and provide a countermodel.

The second sentence is: ""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you accept the possibility of Y.""

The formula I have used to represent this is:

**(□X∧◇(X→Y))→◇Y**

Where the notation I explained above is identical. If you run this through the tree proof generator, it will tell you that the proposition is valid and provide a proof. Please try it out for yourself!

DISCLAIMER: *If you are familiar with logic and modal logic, you may argue that some aspects got ""lost in translation"" from natural language to modal logic. This, however, I'd argue is entirely unavoidable. There is a case to be made for using probabilistic logic instead of modal logic, however, I've evaluated that not only can you make the same argument using modal logic while retaining the core essence of the implications behind the pro-life statement, but I also found it important for the average reader to be able to understand how this ""science"" functions, given most will be unfamiliar with it. That is, I'm using modal logic heuristically, and am not attempting to create a 100% rigorous proof. This is much easier to explain and do when using modal logic, since the reader can simply copy the formula, paste it into a tree proof generator, and see how the program churns out ""valid"" or ""invalid"". This is also, again, not intended to be a 100% scientific explanation, thus the phrasing ""an attempt"" in my post title*.

**CONCLUSION**

There is also a linguistic and legal aspect to this issue that I have not brought up because this post is already quite long. For example, this is exactly why section 74 in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 under British law specifies:

>""Consent to sexual activity may be given to one sort of sexual activity but not another, e.g. to vaginal but not anal sex or penetration with conditions, such as wearing a condom.""

There is a risk that when engaging with a man in sex, he may try to take off the condom secretly, or engage in anal sex when the woman only wanted vaginal sex. But we do not consider the woman to have consented to these clear violations. The problem here is conflating ""consent to an action"", wherein consent is a volitional and intentional act, with ""accepting the risk of an action,"" which does not imply volition or intention in the consequences that follow.

There is also the issue of misrepresenting *implied consent*. Pro-life proponents seem to believe implied consent means that when you consent to something, you consent to every possible consequence. As we've already proven, this is wrong. Implied consent is already a murky and risky topic to delve into precisely because people typically misappropriate it for their own gain. Here is an example of what implied consent is and isn't:

Let's say you go to the clinic to get your bloodwork done. You extend your arm out, and the doctor pulls blood without saying anything. That is implied consent. However, what if you pull your arm away? Is the doctor obligated to pull your blood because you're MEANT to be having bloodwork done, because you're at the clinic, at a bloodwork appointment, and thus the implication is that you want your blood drawn? No, of course not. The doctor will ask for your explicit consent, and if you say no, they won't pull blood. That is the proper usage of implied consent

Many more facets exist to this argument, however, this is a compilation of everything I've been able to put together so far.

**POINT 1: The purpose of pregnancy.**

Something pro-life proponents often claim is that sex is, specifically, an evolved instinct that exists solely for the process of reproduction. The pleasure derived from sex is the byproduct, not the intention. 

But purpose is not a definitive, universal concept; it is rather a human construct meant to allow us to interpret the world. Biology describes the function of something, how it works, but *not* its purpose. Claiming this is a classic example of the is/ought fallacy:

>Reproduction is the biological function of sex, thus, sex ought to be engaged in solely for reproduction.

That is a prescriptive statement meant to logically follow from a descriptive statement, the is/ought fallacy.

To expand on the point about purpose, let me make a structurally identical claim that I'm sure you'll agree is illogical:

>Guns are a concept generated for killing people and/or animals. Using guns at a gun range is a byproduct, not the purpose of owning guns. Thus you should not own guns if you don’t want to kill people and/or animals.

This is, of course, ridiculous! Why can’t I like guns just because they’re cool? Say I buy a gun; if my intent in buying a gun is to shoot it at a shooting range, are we to assume that I’m a cold-hearted killer who wants to shoot people because ""the universe"" decided the purpose of guns is killing? Of course not.

Besides that, claiming that ""purpose is a human construct and subject to interpretation"" is not just me waxing philosophical. The purpose of marriage used to be either political or religious, and still is in many eastern cultures; in western cultures, however, it's love. The purpose of money was facilitating barter systems; nowadays, it's a million different things. The cross was a symbol of torture, now it's a religious symbol of love. The purpose of cocaine was treating disease, now it's substance abuse. The purpose of radioactive materials was making fluorescent glasses and toys, now it's nuclear energy or bombs. The purpose of body hair, eye colour, male nipples, the tailbone, the appendix, wisdom teeth is absolutely nothing biologically, yet they either had or didn't have a purpose at some point long in our ancestors' history (which goes to show that ""biological purpose"" is not the end-all-be-all).

The list can go on forever and ever. These are all things that once had a purpose that has since changed, being re-interpreted by later generations. If society as a whole can re-interpret something, can one person individually not do that for themselves? Societal movements and shifts in thought, after all, always start on the individual level. So then, if you agree with what I've said so far, is it not reasonable for a person to decide on their own what the ""purpose"" of sex is (pleasure), rather than arbitrarily deciding its purpose (reproduction) based on a consensus that benefits your political agenda?

**POINT 2: The logical argument.**

The problem with the pro-life stance is that they typically conflate these two statements as being identical:

>""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you consent to Y.""  
""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you accept the possibility of Y.""

The thing is, that belief is completely, entirely **wrong.** Demonstrably so. The easiest way to point this out is to state that statement 1 is a classic example of a modal scope fallacy, whereas statement 2 is not. However, my point in writing this post is that people don't understand the *implication* of what it means for their argument to be fallacious.

Thus, I will set out to prove this using modal logic. This is an attempt to get over the stigma of pointing out fallacies. I think lots of people see ""logical fallacies"" as funny internet quips thrown around by redditors, but by formalizing the logic behind fallacious arguments in a somewhat rigorous form, I will attempt to demonstrate how making fallacious arguments and standing by them even in the face of overwhelming proof is an active denial of science, that is, the science of logic. Making such statements and standing by them knowing they are fallacious is no different from arguing the earth is flat for all intents and purposes.

I will break down statement number one as follows:

>P1: Consent is given for action X.  
P2: Y is an outcome with any degree of probability of X.  
C: Therefore, consent to X implies consent to Y.

First, I'll first try to prove why this is completely absurd using words, then move on to the modal logic proof.

You consent to X. (P1) If X happens, there is some non-zero chance that Y will also happen. (P2) Therefore, you already consented to Y. (C)""

|Pregnancy|STI|
|:-|:-|
|**X** = “vaginal intercourse with a condom.”|**X** = “vaginal intercourse with a condom.”|
|**Y** = “pregnancy”|**Y** = ""a microscopic condom tear transmits an undetected STI such as HIV""|
|P2: “Even with a condom, pregnancy is possible.”|P2: “Even with a condom, contracting an STI is possible”|
|C: “Therefore, you already consented to pregnancy.”|C: “Therefore, you already consented to contracting an undetected STI.”|

I'm sure you can see that the moral implications of statement 1 are incredibly wrong. I tried my hardest to come up with a perfect, structurally identical example, but even the slightest tweaks in structure can create even more morally dubious claims.

For example, if we remove this structure from the concept of consent alone, you can follow the statement to argue that if a woman walks through the streets alone at night, there is a possibility of her being raped, and she thus already accepted being raped (not the possibility of it as statement 2 implies, she straight up accepted being raped by statement 1's logic). Or, using the same logical structure, you can argue that if a condom breaks during sex, they already consented to the condom breaking, but that’s absurd; the person has no control over whether the condom breaks or not. Or, again, tweaking the structure, you can argue that driving means you have already accepted dying in a car crash. Or, by adding a specific action in the mix, you can argue that stealthing is not illegal because a woman already consented to it. It's all ridiculous.

Now, moving on to the modal logic proof:

[https://www.umsu.de/trees/](https://www.umsu.de/trees/)  
This is a tree proof generator that calculates whether a formula is valid or invalid.

For the first sentence, we have: “If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you consent to Y.”

The formula I used to represent this is:

**(□X∧◇(X→Y))→□Y**

Where □ is the necessity operator as in “you consent to …”, ∧ is the ""AND"" operator, ◇ is the possibility operator, and X → Y reads “whenever X occurs, Y follows.” If you run this through the tree proof generator, it will tell you that the proposition is invalid and provide a countermodel.

The second sentence is: ""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you accept the possibility of Y.""

The formula I have used to represent this is:

**(□X∧◇(X→Y))→◇Y**

Where the notation I explained above is identical. If you run this through the tree proof generator, it will tell you that the proposition is valid and provide a proof. Please try it out for yourself!

DISCLAIMER: *If you are familiar with logic and modal logic, you may argue that some aspects got ""lost in translation"" from natural language to modal logic. This, however, I'd argue is entirely unavoidable. There is a case to be made for using probabilistic logic instead of modal logic, however, I've evaluated that not only can you make the same argument using modal logic while retaining the core essence of the implications behind the pro-life statement, but I also found it important for the average reader to be able to understand how this ""science"" functions, given most will be unfamiliar with it. That is, I'm using modal logic heuristically, and am not attempting to create a 100% rigorous proof. This is much easier to explain and do when using modal logic, since the reader can simply copy the formula, paste it into a tree proof generator, and see how the program churns out ""valid"" or ""invalid"". This is also, again, not intended to be a 100% scientific explanation, thus the phrasing ""an attempt"" in my post title*.

**CONCLUSION**

There is also a linguistic and legal aspect to this issue that I have not brought up because this post is already quite long. For example, this is exactly why section 74 in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 under British law specifies:

>""Consent to sexual activity may be given to one sort of sexual activity but not another, e.g. to vaginal but not anal sex or penetration with conditions, such as wearing a condom.""

There is a risk that when engaging with a man in sex, he may try to take off the condom secretly, or engage in anal sex when the woman only wanted vaginal sex. But we do not consider the woman to have consented to these clear violations. The problem here is conflating ""consent to an action"", wherein consent is a volitional and intentional act, with ""accepting the risk of an action,"" which does not imply volition or intention in the consequences that follow.

There is also the issue of misrepresenting *implied consent*. Pro-life proponents seem to believe implied consent means that when you consent to something, you consent to every possible consequence. As we've already proven, this is wrong. Implied consent is already a murky and risky topic to delve into precisely because people typically misappropriate it for their own gain. Here is an example of what implied consent is and isn't:

Let's say you go to the clinic to get your bloodwork done. You extend your arm out, and the doctor pulls blood without saying anything. That is implied consent. However, what if you pull your arm away? Is the doctor obligated to pull your blood because you're MEANT to be having bloodwork done, because you're at the clinic, at a bloodwork appointment, and thus the implication is that you want your blood drawn? No, of course not. The doctor will ask for your explicit consent, and if you say no, they won't pull blood. That is the proper usage of implied consent

Many more facets exist to this argument, however, this is a compilation of everything I've been able to put together so far.

You may skip this section without losing the essence of what I'm trying to argue in this post. However, I think it is an insightful read, so if you have some time to spend on reading an already long-form post, I encourage you to stick around.

This post is an adaptation from my comments on a recent thread regarding abortion. The point of this post is to explain why pro-life advocates who make the claim:

>Consent to sex = Consent to pregnancy

have a limited understanding of the legal, ethical, logical, and linguistic fields of study/science, or are willfully ignorant. This is not to say that if you hold this opinion as a pro-life advocate, your entire pro-life stance is inherently invalid: it is not, and believing otherwise is yet another example of how pro-life advocates do not understand logic.

Arguments in real life are typically structured using something I call a *disjunctively sufficient justification,* that is, you may hold two separate talking points that are separate but support the same conclusion. For example:

>**P1:** Human life has intrinsic moral value from the moment of conception; terminating it is wrong regardless of consent.  
**P2:** Consent to sex = Consent to pregnancy, and thus, you are responsible for the pregnancy; terminating a fetus you are responsible for is wrong  
**C:** If P1 or P2 is true, termination is wrong.

In logical terms, the formula for what I wrote above is:

>**((P1→C)∧(P2→C))→((P1∨P2)→C)**

DISCLAIMER: *Yes, I know, this is a tautological statement* *(in that it is a single truth-functional statement, which is not what a formal representation would look like). A more accurate logical representation is using ⊢ instead of* ***→*** *between P1/P2 and C, and/or dropping the conjunction symbol, essentially turning it into a sequent, but the proposition alone sufficiently explains our ""perception"" of logic as it applies to real-life argumentation. This post is written in a heuristic manner and aimed towards a layperson audience. For transparency, I will repeat this point by writing other disclaimers throughout the post.*

What I'm saying is that if P1 is true even when P2 is untrue, your argument is still valid. This is how arguments typically work in real life. Modelling only P1 and P2 is disingenuous, because usually, there are many, many Ps that all build atop another both conjunctively and disjunctively in order to get to an actual take/point. However, please note that **P1** in the case above implies that terminating pregnancies that result from rape is wrong. If you don't believe that, your opinion may be structured as a *conjunctively necessary justification,* that is, the two propositions are linked by an AND operator, and disproving one statement disproves your entire argument. Here's an example:

>**P1:** Human life has intrinsic moral value from the moment of conception; ending it is only permissible when the pregnant person is not responsible for the pregnancy.  
**P2:** Consent to sex entails responsibility for the resulting pregnancy.  
**C:** If P1 and P2 are true, termination is wrong, if either or both are false, termination is not wrong.

Ok, great, you get the point. The preface was here to tell you that even if I am right, your argument as a pro-life advocate is not necessarily threatened. The point of my saying this is so you can go into this post with an open mind and accept that what I'm pointing out is, in fact, true, whether you like it or not.

DISCLAIMER: *If you are familiar with logic, you may realize that none of this is formal/rigurous at all. This is true, but vacuously so; it gets the point across to the average reader who is likely unfamiliar with logic. A more formal attempt at a proof is further down in the post, under point 2. However, again, do note that the target audience for this is the average layperson, not a logician, and this is self-evident from my post title: ""an attempt.""*

**POINT 1: The purpose of pregnancy.**

Something pro-life proponents often claim is that sex is, specifically, an evolved instinct that exists solely for the process of reproduction. The pleasure derived from sex is the byproduct, not the intention. 

But purpose is not a definitive, universal concept; it is rather a human construct meant to allow us to interpret the world. Biology describes the function of something, how it works, but *not* its purpose. Claiming this is a classic example of the is/ought fallacy:

>Reproduction is the biological function of sex, thus, sex ought to be engaged in solely for reproduction.

That is a prescriptive statement meant to logically follow from a descriptive statement, the is/ought fallacy.

To expand on the point about purpose, let me make a structurally identical claim that I'm sure you'll agree is illogical:

>Guns are a concept generated for killing people and/or animals. Using guns at a gun range is a byproduct, not the purpose of owning guns. Thus you should not own guns if you don’t want to kill people and/or animals.

This is, of course, ridiculous! Why can’t I like guns just because they’re cool? Say I buy a gun; if my intent in buying a gun is to shoot it at a shooting range, are we to assume that I’m a cold-hearted killer who wants to shoot people because ""the universe"" decided the purpose of guns is killing? Of course not.

Besides that, claiming that ""purpose is a human construct and subject to interpretation"" is not just me waxing philosophical. The purpose of marriage used to be either political or religious, and still is in many eastern cultures; in western cultures, however, it's love. The purpose of money was facilitating barter systems; nowadays, it's a million different things. The cross was a symbol of torture, now it's a religious symbol of love. The purpose of cocaine was treating disease, now it's substance abuse. The purpose of radioactive materials was making fluorescent glasses and toys, now it's nuclear energy or bombs. The purpose of body hair, eye colour, male nipples, the tailbone, the appendix, wisdom teeth is absolutely nothing biologically, yet they either had or didn't have a purpose at some point long in our ancestors' history (which goes to show that ""biological purpose"" is not the end-all-be-all).

The list can go on forever and ever. These are all things that once had a purpose that has since changed, being re-interpreted by later generations. If society as a whole can re-interpret something, can one person individually not do that for themselves? Societal movements and shifts in thought, after all, always start on the individual level. So then, if you agree with what I've said so far, is it not reasonable for a person to decide on their own what the ""purpose"" of sex is (pleasure), rather than arbitrarily deciding its purpose (reproduction) based on a consensus that benefits your political agenda?

**POINT 2: The logical argument.**

The problem with the pro-life stance is that they typically conflate these two statements as being identical:

>""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you consent to Y.""  
""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you accept the possibility of Y.""

The thing is, that belief is completely, entirely **wrong.** Demonstrably so. The easiest way to point this out is to state that statement 1 is a classic example of a modal scope fallacy, whereas statement 2 is not. However, my point in writing this post is that people don't understand the *implication* of what it means for their argument to be fallacious.

Thus, I will set out to prove this using modal logic. This is an attempt to get over the stigma of pointing out fallacies. I think lots of people see ""logical fallacies"" as funny internet quips thrown around by redditors, but by formalizing the logic behind fallacious arguments in a somewhat rigorous form, I will attempt to demonstrate how making fallacious arguments and standing by them even in the face of overwhelming proof is an active denial of science, that is, the science of logic. Making such statements and standing by them knowing they are fallacious is no different from arguing the earth is flat for all intents and purposes.

I will break down statement number one as follows:

>P1: Consent is given for action X.  
P2: Y is an outcome with any degree of probability of X.  
C: Therefore, consent to X implies consent to Y.

First, I'll first try to prove why this is completely absurd using words, then move on to the modal logic proof.

You consent to X. (P1) If X happens, there is some non-zero chance that Y will also happen. (P2) Therefore, you already consented to Y. (C)""

|Pregnancy|STI|
|:-|:-|
|**X** = “vaginal intercourse with a condom.”|**X** = “vaginal intercourse with a condom.”|
|**Y** = “pregnancy”|**Y** = ""a microscopic condom tear transmits an undetected STI such as HIV""|
|P2: “Even with a condom, pregnancy is possible.”|P2: “Even with a condom, contracting an STI is possible”|
|C: “Therefore, you already consented to pregnancy.”|C: “Therefore, you already consented to contracting an undetected STI.”|

I'm sure you can see that the moral implications of statement 1 are incredibly wrong. I tried my hardest to come up with a perfect, structurally identical example, but even the slightest tweaks in structure can create even more morally dubious claims.

For example, if we remove this structure from the concept of consent alone, you can follow the statement to argue that if a woman walks through the streets alone at night, there is a possibility of her being raped, and she thus already accepted being raped (not the possibility of it as statement 2 implies, she straight up accepted being raped by statement 1's logic). Or, using the same logical structure, you can argue that if a condom breaks during sex, they already consented to the condom breaking, but that’s absurd; the person has no control over whether the condom breaks or not. Or, again, tweaking the structure, you can argue that driving means you have already accepted dying in a car crash. Or, by adding a specific action in the mix, you can argue that stealthing is not illegal because a woman already consented to it. It's all ridiculous.

Now, moving on to the modal logic proof:

[https://www.umsu.de/trees/](https://www.umsu.de/trees/)  
This is a tree proof generator that calculates whether a formula is valid or invalid.

For the first sentence, we have: “If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you consent to Y.”

The formula I used to represent this is:

**(□X∧◇(X→Y))→□Y**

Where □ is the necessity operator as in “you consent to …”, ∧ is the ""AND"" operator, ◇ is the possibility operator, and X → Y reads “whenever X occurs, Y follows.” If you run this through the tree proof generator, it will tell you that the proposition is invalid and provide a countermodel.

The second sentence is: ""If you consent to X, and X may cause Y, then you accept the possibility of Y.""

The formula I have used to represent this is:

**(□X∧◇(X→Y))→◇Y**

Where the notation I explained above is identical. If you run this through the tree proof generator, it will tell you that the proposition is valid and provide a proof. Please try it out for yourself!

DISCLAIMER: *If you are familiar with logic and modal logic, you may argue that some aspects got ""lost in translation"" from natural language to modal logic. This, however, I'd argue is entirely unavoidable. There is a case to be made for using probabilistic logic instead of modal logic, however, I've evaluated that not only can you make the same argument using modal logic while retaining the core essence of the implications behind the pro-life statement, but I also found it important for the average reader to be able to understand how this ""science"" functions, given most will be unfamiliar with it. That is, I'm using modal logic heuristically, and am not attempting to create a 100% rigorous proof. This is much easier to explain and do when using modal logic, since the reader can simply copy the formula, paste it into a tree proof generator, and see how the program churns out ""valid"" or ""invalid"". This is also, again, not intended to be a 100% scientific explanation, thus the phrasing ""an attempt"" in my post title*.

**CONCLUSION**

There is also a linguistic and legal aspect to this issue that I have not brought up because this post is already quite long. For example, this is exactly why section 74 in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 under British law specifies:

>""Consent to sexual activity may be given to one sort of sexual activity but not another, e.g. to vaginal but not anal sex or penetration with conditions, such as wearing a condom.""

There is a risk that when engaging with a man in sex, he may try to take off the condom secretly, or engage in anal sex when the woman only wanted vaginal sex. But we do not consider the woman to have consented to these clear violations. The problem here is conflating ""consent to an action"", wherein consent is a volitional and intentional act, with ""accepting the risk of an action,"" which does not imply volition or intention in the consequences that follow.

There is also the issue of misrepresenting *implied consent*. Pro-life proponents seem to believe implied consent means that when you consent to something, you consent to every possible consequence. As we've already proven, this is wrong. Implied consent is already a murky and risky topic to delve into precisely because people typically misappropriate it for their own gain. Here is an example of what implied consent is and isn't:

Let's say you go to the clinic to get your bloodwork done. You extend your arm out, and the doctor pulls blood without saying anything. That is implied consent. However, what if you pull your arm away? Is the doctor obligated to pull your blood because you're MEANT to be having bloodwork done, because you're at the clinic, at a bloodwork appointment, and thus the implication is that you want your blood drawn? No, of course not. The doctor will ask for your explicit consent, and if you say no, they won't pull blood. That is the proper usage of implied consent

Many more facets exist to this argument, however, this is a compilation of everything I've been able to put together so far.

Thank you for reading.","consent to an action ≠ consent to consequences : an attempt at formalization using modal logic . * * preface * * you may skip this section without the essence of what i 'm trying to argue in this post . however , i think it is an read , so if you have some time to spend on reading an already long-form post , i you to stick around . this post is an adaptation from my comments on a recent thread regarding abortion . the point of this post is to explain why pro-life who make the claim : > consent to sex = consent to pregnancy have a understanding of the legal , , , and linguistic fields of study/science , or are willfully . this is not to say that if you hold this opinion as a pro-life , your entire pro-life stance is inherently : it is not , and believing otherwise is yet another example of how pro-life do not understand logic . arguments in real life are typically structured using something i call a * disjunctively justification , * that is , you may hold two separate talking points that are separate but the same conclusion . for example : > * * p1 : * * human life has intrinsic moral value from the moment of conception ; terminating it is regardless of consent . * * p2 : * * consent to sex = consent to pregnancy , and thus , you are responsible for the pregnancy ; terminating a fetus you are responsible for is * * c : * * if p1 or p2 is true , termination is . in terms , the formula for what i wrote above is : > * * ( ( p1→c ) ∧ ( p2→c ) ) → ( ( p1∨p2 ) →c ) * * disclaimer : * yes , i know , this is a tautological statement * * ( in that it is a single truth-functional statement , which is not what a formal representation would look ) . a more representation is using ⊢ instead of * * * * → * * * * between p1/p2 and c , and/or dropping the conjunction symbol , essentially turning it into a sequent , but the proposition alone explains our `` perception '' of logic as it applies to real-life argumentation . this post is written in a heuristic manner and aimed towards a layperson audience . for transparency , i will repeat this point by writing other disclaimers throughout the post . * what i 'm saying is that if p1 is true even when p2 is , your argument is still valid . this is how arguments typically in real life . modelling only p1 and p2 is , because usually , there are many , many ps that all build atop another both conjunctively and disjunctively in order to get to an actual take/point . however , please note that * * p1 * * in the case above implies that terminating pregnancies that result from is . if you do n't believe that , your opinion may be structured as a * conjunctively necessary justification , * that is , the two propositions are linked by an and operator , and disproving one statement disproves your entire argument . here 's an example : > * * p1 : * * human life has intrinsic moral value from the moment of conception ; ending it is only when the pregnant person is not responsible for the pregnancy . * * p2 : * * consent to sex entails responsibility for the resulting pregnancy . * * c : * * if p1 and p2 are true , termination is , if either or both are , termination is not . ok , , you get the point . the preface was here to tell you that even if i am , your argument as a pro-life is not necessarily threatened . the point of my saying this is so you can go into this post with an open mind and accept that what i 'm pointing out is , in fact , true , whether you it or not . disclaimer : * if you are familiar with logic , you may realize that none of this is formal/rigurous at all . this is true , but vacuously so ; it gets the point across to the average reader who is likely with logic . a more formal attempt at a proof is further down in the post , under point 2. however , again , do note that the target audience for this is the average layperson , not a logician , and this is self-evident from my post title : `` an attempt . `` * * * point 1 : the purpose of pregnancy . * * something pro-life proponents often claim is that sex is , specifically , an evolved instinct that exists solely for the process of reproduction . the derived from sex is the byproduct , not the intention . but purpose is not a definitive , universal concept ; it is rather a human construct meant to allow us to interpret the world . biology describes the function of something , how it , but * not * its purpose . claiming this is a example of the is/ought : > reproduction is the biological function of sex , thus , sex ought to be engaged in solely for reproduction . that is a prescriptive statement meant to logically follow from a descriptive statement , the is/ought . to expand on the point about purpose , let me make a structurally identical claim that i 'm sure you 'll agree is : > guns are a concept generated for people and/or animals . using guns at a gun range is a byproduct , not the purpose of owning guns . thus you should not own guns if you don ’ t want to people and/or animals . this is , of course , ! why can ’ t i guns just because they ’ re ? say i buy a gun ; if my intent in buying a gun is to shoot it at a shooting range , are we to assume that i ’ m a cold-hearted who wants to shoot people because `` the universe '' decided the purpose of guns is ? of course not . besides that , claiming that `` purpose is a human construct and subject to interpretation '' is not just me waxing philosophical . the purpose of marriage used to be either political or religious , and still is in many eastern cultures ; in western cultures , however , it 's . the purpose of money was facilitating barter systems ; nowadays , it 's a million different things . the cross was a symbol of , now it 's a religious symbol of . the purpose of cocaine was treating disease , now it 's substance . the purpose of radioactive materials was making fluorescent glasses and toys , now it 's nuclear energy or bombs . the purpose of body hair , eye colour , male nipples , the tailbone , the appendix , teeth is absolutely nothing biologically , yet they either had or did n't have a purpose at some point long in our ancestors ' history ( which goes to show that `` biological purpose '' is not the end-all-be-all ) . the list can go on forever and ever . these are all things that once had a purpose that has since changed , being re-interpreted by later generations . if society as a whole can re-interpret something , can one person individually not do that for themselves ? societal movements and shifts in thought , after all , always start on the individual level . so then , if you agree with what i 've said so far , is it not for a person to decide on their own what the `` purpose '' of sex is ( ) , rather than arbitrarily deciding its purpose ( reproduction ) based on a consensus that your political agenda ? * * point 2 : the argument . * * the with the pro-life stance is that they typically conflate these two statements as being identical : > '' if you consent to x , and x may cause y , then you consent to y . '' `` if you consent to x , and x may cause y , then you accept the possibility of y . '' the thing is , that belief is completely , entirely * * . * * demonstrably so . the way to point this out is to state that statement 1 is a example of a modal scope , whereas statement 2 is not . however , my point in writing this post is that people do n't understand the * * of what it means for their argument to be . thus , i will set out to prove this using modal logic . this is an attempt to get over the of pointing out . i think lots of people see `` '' as internet quips thrown around by redditors , but by formalizing the logic behind arguments in a somewhat rigorous form , i will attempt to demonstrate how making arguments and standing by them even in the face of proof is an active of science , that is , the science of logic . making such statements and standing by them knowing they are is no different from arguing the earth is flat for all intents and purposes . i will down statement number one as follows : > p1 : consent is given for action x. p2 : y is an outcome with any degree of probability of x. c : therefore , consent to x implies consent to y. first , i 'll first try to prove why this is completely using words , then move on to the modal logic proof . you consent to x . ( p1 ) if x happens , there is some non-zero chance that y will also happen . ( p2 ) therefore , you already consented to y . ( c ) '' |pregnancy|sti| | : -| : -| | * * x * * = “ vaginal intercourse with a condom. ” | * * x * * = “ vaginal intercourse with a condom. ” | | * * y * * = “ pregnancy ” | * * y * * = `` a microscopic condom tear transmits an undetected sti such as hiv '' | |p2 : “ even with a condom , pregnancy is possible. ” |p2 : “ even with a condom , contracting an sti is possible ” | |c : “ therefore , you already consented to pregnancy. ” |c : “ therefore , you already consented to contracting an undetected sti. ” | i 'm sure you can see that the moral implications of statement 1 are . i tried my hardest to come up with a , structurally identical example , but even the slightest tweaks in structure can create even more morally claims . for example , if we remove this structure from the concept of consent alone , you can follow the statement to argue that if a woman walks through the streets alone at night , there is a possibility of her being , and she thus already accepted being ( not the possibility of it as statement 2 implies , she straight up accepted being by statement 1 's logic ) . or , using the same structure , you can argue that if a condom during sex , they already consented to the condom , but that ’ s ; the person has no control over whether the condom or not . or , again , tweaking the structure , you can argue that driving means you have already accepted in a car . or , by adding a specific action in the mix , you can argue that stealthing is not because a woman already consented to it . it 's all . now , moving on to the modal logic proof : [ https : //www.umsu.de/trees/ ] ( https : //www.umsu.de/trees/ ) this is a tree proof generator that calculates whether a formula is valid or . for the first sentence , we have : “ if you consent to x , and x may cause y , then you consent to y. ” the formula i used to represent this is : * * ( □x∧◇ ( x→y ) ) →□y * * where □ is the necessity operator as in “ you consent to … ” , ∧ is the `` and '' operator , ◇ is the possibility operator , and x → y reads “ whenever x occurs , y follows. ” if you run this through the tree proof generator , it will tell you that the proposition is and provide a countermodel . the second sentence is : `` if you consent to x , and x may cause y , then you accept the possibility of y . '' the formula i have used to represent this is : * * ( □x∧◇ ( x→y ) ) →◇y * * where the notation i explained above is identical . if you run this through the tree proof generator , it will tell you that the proposition is valid and provide a proof . please try it out for yourself ! disclaimer : * if you are familiar with logic and modal logic , you may argue that some aspects got `` in translation '' from natural language to modal logic . this , however , i 'd argue is entirely unavoidable . there is a case to be made for using probabilistic logic instead of modal logic , however , i 've evaluated that not only can you make the same argument using modal logic while retaining the core essence of the implications behind the pro-life statement , but i also found it for the average reader to be able to understand how this `` science '' functions , given most will be with it . that is , i 'm using modal logic heuristically , and am not attempting to create a 100 % rigorous proof . this is much to explain and do when using modal logic , since the reader can simply copy the formula , paste it into a tree proof generator , and see how the program churns out `` valid '' or `` '' . this is also , again , not intended to be a 100 % scientific explanation , thus the phrasing `` an attempt '' in my post title * . * * conclusion * * there is also a linguistic and legal aspect to this that i have not brought up because this post is already quite long . for example , this is exactly why section 74 in the sexual offences act 2003 under british law specifies : > '' consent to sexual activity may be given to one sort of sexual activity but not another , e.g . to vaginal but not anal sex or penetration with conditions , such as wearing a condom .

","gun control question for  this question is meant in , and i ’ d to have a civil and discussion unlike many posts on this sub . for reference , i ’ m a republican and fully pro-2a .  have called for much stricter gun control , including some calling for weapon bans ( “ civilians don ’ t need weapons of war ” ) . even though handguns cause more and by a mile than any other type of gun . i think everyone agrees that individual murders , school shootings , etc are and something definitely needs to change . my question is : assuming for the sake of this conversation that weapons are not banned , nor any other type of gun , what control measures would you implement that would achieve the goal you are searching for ? you for any responses . i ’ m hoping to see some differing opinions and solutions than those that i have considered , and the rationale behind them ."

He says if I don't get them tied and or removed he will never sleep with me again. That he'll use something plastic, he would slam his lower body part in a car door so he can't make babies, even went as far as saying he didn't get married to wear condoms that if that's the case he'll sleep with other people.

Not exactly sure how to phrase this or anything as this is my first time ever posting (23F). My husband (34M) wants me to get my tubes removed after our baby's born in 3 months. This is our 2nd child together and I have one from a previous relationship. (He also has one form a previous marriage (( I'm his 3rd wife)) that's he's never met or seen in person but pays monthly child support to). He is ADAMANT he doesn't want anymore children and honestly I don't believe I do either, but the thought of never being able to have children ever again is terrifying and not something I want to set in stone. He also refuses to have a vasectomy as when he was medically discharged from the military he apparently was paralyzed from the waste down (it was a short time he was like that) and that he will never take the risk of losing function down there or let the VA do surgery on him as they've apparently almost k.o. him a few times already. He says if I don't get them tied and or removed he will never sleep with me again. That he'll use something plastic, he would slam his lower body part in a car door so he can't make babies, even went as far as saying he didn't get married to wear condoms that if that's the case he'll sleep with other people. Has went as far as saying if we have a 3rd together he'd k.o. himself in the shed. Just alot of negative and nasty things. Constantly brings up how he'll never touch or sleep with me again, or that he'll k.o. 

It's not a money situation on the more kids, yes it would be tight around the house but it's definitely something we could do. He has a over 30-50k collection of guns alone. Not including all of the smaller things he has collected that definitely adds up in price as well. We're middle class, not high up but not low either. We own our home, have 2 cars we also own, and don't pay mortgage or taxes as he's 100% ""disabled"" and retired from the military. I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking to hear here, I guess I'm trying to feel vindicated on putting my foot down. As I don't want to remove organs from my body so he can get off care . (He also has said he'd divorce me if I ever got on birth control as he won't deal with the extra hormones, and says he doesn't even want there to be an accident ""child' that he will not take the risk.)  I just can't imagine setting in stone that I'll never have anymore children. I know 3 is ALOT for some and honestly it seems like it may be the last ill have as well but I still just cannot get behind the option being taken away.

It is a bit disturbing that there is always shooting incident happening in . I am planning to go to the  for a holiday very soon. However, I am afraid to go to  due to frequent shooting incidents that are happening.

keen to hear your views and opinions .

When you compare what we have to the rest of the developed world, we literally have the worst of all worlds. We pay more per capita than other countries only to get worse results.

I'm a big supporter of capitalism, and it's a system that capable of miraculous things, but this isn't one of them. This is an area that should be socialized and managed by the government to remove the for profit incentive... like literally all the other developed countries do. Just like public infrastructure, education, and defense, healthcare needs to be on that list. People's lives are at stake.

I'm just so sick of health insurance companies. I'm tired of dealing with copays and deductibles and bullshit billing codes and in/out of network providers and not being covered when I need coverage the most. It's not just me, I see it with everybody in my life. The entire system is designed to be confusing, stressful, and borderline fraudulent. These corporations are the most evil, corrupt, and ghoulish entities this country has ever produced and everybody universally hates them... so why are they around? 

I understand that this is a nationwide issue, but this is the most liberal state in the country and all of our elected representatives claim to be for it, so why isn't it done?

If somebody still wants private health insurance anyway, fine, maybe they can get a tax deduction at the end of the year, but I know most people are going to flee in mass from health insurance companies the first chance they get.

I really don't mind paying extra from my paychecks if it means I can get good quality healthcare and not have to deal with health insurance companies anymore.

https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1la2m5r/cmv_maga_is_a_kind_of_class_war_against_the/,universal healthcare,CMV: MAGA is a kind of class war against the educated,"
Let me explain. I believe the MAGA movement is the product of a small group of right-wing ideologues who have very successfully tapped into working-class resentment toward the college-educated and managerial classes. They’ve weaponized that resentment to build popular support for authoritarian ambitions. I want to explain: (a) why I believe there’s a concerted effort to disempower the educated class, (b) why they’re being targeted, and (c) why this has traction with those without college degrees. I’ll be making some broad generalizations about class.



1. Why do I think this exists?

A lot of this comes from personal experience. I  am a college educated person.  I work as a mid-level federal employee and my wife is in upper nonprofit management. Until recently, we were comfortable—not wealthy, but secure. We could afford good childcare, travel, and live well. Like most of our friends in D.C., we had solid benefits: healthcare, parental leave, retirement plans. That’s changed dramatically since January.



Roughly a third of our social circle (we both work closely with USAID)—people we know well enough to set up playdates with or have over for dinner have been laid off, sometimes both parents. My wife’s job is now precarious; mine is by no means secure. 

There’s an atmosphere of pressure—ideological as much as financial. We’re told to drop pronouns from our email signatures, deemphasize our ethnic identities, and essentially stop celebrating diversity. We can’t even release basic statistics without executive approval. The message is clear: there’s a new boss, and he doesn’t care about what you think, he just wants you to do as you're told or leave.



This isn’t isolated. NPR and PBS are under fire, CBS and ABC have faced lawsuits, legacy media in general is vilified by the President and his allies. More than anything, however, it's higher education in general that is targeted. 

Because where do these arrogant and sanctimonious  experts and bureaucrats come from? Universities. Hence the sustained attacks on Harvard, Columbia, and many more. The message: stop pushing progressive values or pay the price. There is a war on expertise.



2. Why is this happening?

Because the expert class is powerful—and votes Democrat. During Trump’s first term, mid-to-upper level officials in the FBI, CDC, State, and even the Pentagon pushed back against White House directives. The press, the courts, the universities—they all slowed or blocked authoritarian initiatives. So now, the goal is to defang them. Fire them. Undermine their work. Make them feel threatened and unsure of themselves.



Culturally, this group has had a good run. If you are happy that a man can marry a man or a woman a woman, you have the educated progressives to thank.  If you think that it's progress that a woman can sue her boss for sexual harassment, and might even win, it's the university educated set that did that too. And if you use words like ""misogyny"" or ""systemic racism"", you learned them from the college degree holding population.  Probably you have one yourself. 

The educated class has a great influence over the whole country.  Undermining them would mark a major shift in American political power, possibly reversing a progressive trajectory decades in the making.



3. Why do non-college educated voters support this?

Since 2016, Republicans—especially MAGA—have gained with voters without degrees, across races. Trump’s coarse style signals disdain for educated elites. That resonates with a large, culturally underrepresented demographic: working-class Americans. Why? Because many feel sneered at and left behind.



Of course, this is not new.  Historically, elites have always looked down on the “unrefined.” But three modern developments intensified that resentment:



First, the sneer turned moral. It wasn’t just, “you’re unsophisticated,” it became, “you’re immoral if you don’t think like us.  You are bad if you don't use the words that we do and support our causes”
Second, the internet and social media amplified this dynamic at unprecedented scale.  Political and cultural disputes disseminated at the speed of light across the country and turned politics into a kind of sporting event.  
Third, progressives prioritized social issues—Pride, MeToo, BLM—over core labor concerns like paid sick leave or vacation, which are basic rights elsewhere.  I think if educated progressives had amplified workers' rights to the same degree that I had any of those other three issues, the uneducated classes would have noticed and appreciated that.  




And the working class noticed. They didn’t see themselves reflected in progressive movements. That left an opening MAGA exploited. Are they going to fight for labor rights? No. But they don’t have to. They’ve started a class war against the university-educated—and it’s working, so far.

Change my view.","cmv : maga is a kind of class war against the let me explain . i believe the maga movement is the product of a small group of right-wing ideologues who have very tapped into working-class toward the college-educated and managerial classes . they ’ ve weaponized that to build for ambitions . i want to explain : ( a ) why i believe there ’ s a concerted effort to disempower the class , ( b ) why they ’ re being targeted , and ( c ) why this has with those without college degrees . i ’ ll be making some broad generalizations about class . 1. why do i think this exists ? a lot of this comes from personal experience . i am a college person . i as a mid-level federal employee and my wife is in upper nonprofit management . until recently , we were comfortable—not , but . we could childcare , travel , and live . most of our friends in d.c. , we had : healthcare , parental leave , retirement plans . that ’ s changed dramatically since january . roughly a third of our social circle ( we both closely with usaid ) —people we know to set up playdates with or have over for dinner have been laid off , sometimes both parents . my wife ’ s job is now ; mine is by no means . there ’ s an atmosphere of pressure—ideological as much as financial . we ’ re told to drop pronouns from our email signatures , deemphasize our ethnic identities , and essentially stop celebrating diversity . we can ’ t even release basic statistics without executive . the message is : there ’ s a new boss , and he doesn ’ t care about what you think , he  wants you to do as you 're told or leave . this isn ’ t . npr and pbs are under fire , cbs and abc have faced lawsuits , legacy media in general is vilified by the president and his allies . more than anything , however , it 's higher education in general that is targeted . because where do these and experts and bureaucrats come from ? universities . hence the sustained on harvard , columbia , and many more . the message : stop pushing values or pay the price . there is a war on expertise . 2. why is this happening ? because the expert class is powerful—and votes democrat . during ’ s first term , mid-to-upper level officials in the fbi , cdc , state , and even the pentagon pushed back against white house directives . the press , the courts , the universities—they all or blocked initiatives . so now , the goal is to defang them . fire them . their .  them feel threatened and of themselves . culturally , this group has had a run . if you are that a man can marry a man or a woman a woman , you have the progressives to . if you think that it 's that a woman can her boss for sexual , and might even , it 's the university set that did that too . and if you use words `` misogyny '' or `` systemic '' , you learned them from the college degree holding population . probably you have one yourself . the class has a influence over the whole country . them would mark a major shift in american political power , possibly reversing a trajectory decades in the making . 3. why do non-college voters this ? since 2016 , republicans—especially maga—have with voters without degrees , across races . ’ s style signals for elites . that resonates with a large , culturally underrepresented demographic : working-class  . why ? because many feel sneered at and left behind . of course , this is not new . historically , elites have always looked down on the “ unrefined. ” but three developments intensified that : first , the turned moral . it wasn ’ t  , “ you ’ re , ” it became , “ you ’ re if you don ’ t think us . you are if you do n't use the words that we do and our causes ” second , the internet and social media amplified this at unprecedented scale . political and cultural disputes disseminated at the speed of light across the country and turned politics into a kind of sporting event . third , progressives prioritized social issues—pride , metoo , blm—over core labor paid leave or vacation , which are basic rights elsewhere . i think if progressives had amplified workers ' rights to the same degree that i had any of those other three , the uneducated classes would have noticed and that . and the working class noticed . they didn ’ t see themselves reflected in movements . that left an opening maga exploited . are they going to fight for labor rights ? no . but they don ’ t have to . they ’ ve started a class war against the university-educated—and it ’ s working , so far . change my view ."

Influenced by those vultures around him, Trump is trying to cause an economic collapse and social chaos.

Sabotaging the economy will provide a reason to declare a state of emergency and seize all powers. The Insurrection Act of 1807 is a United States federal law that empowers the president of the United States to deploy the U.S. military and federalized National Guard troops within the United States in particular circumstances, such as to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, or rebellion. With an economic crash, this administration gang of gangsters hope for riots and unrest, which would allow Trump to invoke this Act.

This seizing of powers during a time of crisis has initially been proposed by the reactionary and extreme libertarian Curtis Yavin, which is basically saying that since liberal and progressive America is headed towards a crisis that will impair the democracy and cripple most of the institutions that provide its checks and balances, then a Ceasar like figure should emerge and take powers, like some kind of benevolent dictator. In this sick fantasy he argues that progressive ideals have led to societal decay and advocates for a reboot of society. I believe the Trump administration gangsters - who are influenced by Yavin's ideas - are pursuing this sick fantasy.

The CPAC that is trying to arrange for trump to stay beyond two terms, even arrogantly put a picture of Trump as Caesar as their logo. Trump himself is now overtly gloating that there are ""methods"" for him to stay (as per my first paragraph).

That method probably now includes a strategy on how to capture all states, by way of Gerrymandering pushed at exponential levels, since many States' Supreme Courts and Governors positions have been taken over by MAGA pundits. (I'm happy that the Wisconsin Supreme Court has resisted this trend; some good news in this sea of gloomy news).

Reducing the freedom of reporters, and barring print and TV media, or at minimum providing intense government pressure over them to control the narrative (as we've seen for Associated Press and the Gulf of America Mexico debacle) is part of the plan.

Dismantling government fight against misinformation now even deviously facilitates foreign governments to intervene in American elections and push Trump's narrative.

Taking over and crippling USPS (as we've seen recently), starting by firing its head and ""overhauling"" the service is for the purpose of controlling mail, and destroying the possibilities to have fair vote by mail.

Firing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and putting one of his cronies in charge, is to be able to have martial law and use the army against the citizens, if need be. And now more senior military and intelligence figures are being fired and will be replaced by docile elements. Some of these very competent people are even being fired due to crazy lobbyists having access to Trump. With these high ranking people put aside, it's likely that a planned invasion of Greenland (AKA Denmark, a NATO ally and a European country!) could be started.

Closing the Department of Education, ending funding to universities, ending affirmative action programs, will ensure that access to a good education stays limited and unaffordable to at least half the population and for poorest and most discriminated against citizens (in the USA half the population has access to a few percentage of the wealth).

Having poorly educated constituents, will make manipulation of people easier, simply using populist slogans and empty promises. Uneducated people can be made to worry about bogus social issues such as a few trans athletes, while ignoring major issues such as society's wealth being funneled to an extremely small percentage of the population.

Massacring Medicaid and Medicaid will contribute to keep the poorest 50% of the population from having easy and universal access to healthcare. This, associated with the education points above, will further contribute to make half the population unable to perform critical thinking, and solely focus on making the ends meet, from paycheck to paycheck. That way, that's less people worrying about their civil rights and being critical of their government.

Firing JAG, lawyers, judges, etc. will make fair and unbiased justice unattainable to the average citizens. They are also restraining the freedom of many law firms and ensuring millions of dollars of free law services flow towards the Federal government.

And with government being ordered to provide resources to law enforcement accused of wrongdoing, it becomes easier to purposefully suppress or trample civil liberties and freedom of speech, exactly as in a dictatorship and police state.

It's a coup. a slow motion one, but a coup.

And the majority of Americans are just too stupid or too blind to see it. Or, they are too focused on other unimportant concerns that have been built into a narrative to divert people's minds from the true problems. They are transforming the American democracy into an oligarchy. It seems like a conspiracy theory, but it's in plain sight for all to see, announced in the Project 2025 and elsewhere (see my first paragraph).

This, associated with the education points above, will further contribute to  half the population unable to perform critical thinking, and solely focus on making the ends meet, from paycheck to paycheck. That way, that's less people worrying about their civil rights and being critical of their government.

Firing JAG, lawyers, judges, etc. will  fair and unbiased justice unattainable to the average citizens. They are also restraining the freedom of many law firms and ensuring millions of dollars of  law services flow towards the Federal government.

And with government being ordered to provide resources to law enforcement accused of wrongdoing, it becomes easier to purposefully suppress or trample civil liberties and freedom of speech, exactly as in a dictatorship and police state.

It's a coup. a slow motion one, but a coup.

Or, they are too focused on other unimportant concerns that have been built into a narrative to divert people's minds from the true problems.

https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1l1zc9k/cmv_everyone_should_want_a_strong_societal_safety/,universal healthcare,"CMV: everyone should want a strong societal safety net, i.e. Welfare and social programs, if not for moral reasons, for practical reasons.","I’ll be upfront. I grew up poor, poorer than most people think is possible in the U.S.. So yes, I’ve got a bit of a bleeding heart. I believe in compassion, and I do think a wealthy society has a moral obligation to make sure it's vulnerable populations aren't suffering. But even if you don’t share those values, I still think the case for a strong safety net is nigh self-evident. 


Here’s the basic idea: when the poorest people in a society have what they need to live with dignity, and when they have a real shot at improving their lives, not just as a social myth, that society becomes more stable. There’s less crime. Less unrest. Less chaos. This isn’t wishful thinking. It’s what history, economics, and common sense tell us. 

People who are starving, stuck in rundown housing, or trapped in hopeless poverty, especially in a country that prides itself on opportunity and wealth, don’t just quietly accept their lot. Some steal. Some riot. Some fall into addiction or despair. Others become radicalized. And no amount of police or gated communities can protect a society where millions feel like they have nothing left to lose.

Now look at the opposite: when people feel like they have enough to survive, to grow, and to build something of their own, or even just to be comfortable, they become stakeholders. They get invested in the success of the society around them. They’re less likely to loot your store or break into your car. Even if you’re wealthy, or doing fine–even if you're Gordon ""greed is good"" Gecko or some Ayn Randian captain of industry, it’s still in your interest to live in a world where people are hopeful instead of desperate. 

That’s where things like universal healthcare, good public schools, subsidized housing, or even universal basic income come in. Not as dreamy handouts, but as safety valves. A quality social net won't fix everything, but it will prevent millions of us from falling slipping through the cracks, or at the very least mitigate the worst consequences.

Some people believe welfare makes people lazy lazy. Maybe that's true in some cases, but if I'm not wrong statistically speaking that's easily disprovable as most who use welfare get off after a couple years. But let’s be honest, what kills motivation more than working two jobs and still falling behind? The best incentive is hope. The best fuel for ambition is the belief that if you try, you might actually get somewhere, and if you try and fail, a second chance isn't a miracle. 

So yeah, I care about the poor because I was one. But even if you don’t, even if you’re just trying to protect your neighborhood, your wallet, or your peace of mind, you should still want the people at the bottom to have food, shelter, a few modern conveniences, and a real chance at something better.

CMV.

EDIT: A lot of replies seem to miss the core of my argument. Just to clarify:

1. I'm not debating logistics or cost. I'm not arguing about how we fund a safety net. I'm saying people should want one. If the political will existed, paying for it would be the easy part. Our defense budget is over 800 billion and we have a billionaire class that generates a comparable sum of wealth each year. The real issue is the lack of will, not the lack of money.

2. I'm not making a moral argument, so arguing the morals of it miss my point. I'm explicitly asking people to set aside ideology and values. The claim is that a strong safety net is rational self-interest. If you're not rich, it protects you from ruin if you lose your job or face a crisis. If you are rich, it helps prevent social collapse. History shows what happens when inequality festers: unrest, populism, and yes, sometimes violence. Stability is in everyone's interest.

3. ""It makes people lazy"" is still a moral argument. You're appealing to a value judgment (virtue vs vice). But if you insist on this argument, just ask yourself this to better understand my point: would you rather a lazy person who’s housed, fed, and calm? Or a highly motivated person who sees crime as their only chance at a better life? It's a cynical comparison, but I'm making a cynical claim appealing to outcomes, not ideals.

4. If you're citing studies claiming welfare causes dysfunction, be honest, you're cherry-picking. The overwhelming trend in research shows that strong social safety nets reduce crime, improve health, and increase long-term productivity. In my opinion best argument against them is economic feasibility, but then see point one.

I’ll be upfront. I grew up poor, poorer than most people think is possible in the U.S.. So yes, I’ve got a bit of a bleeding heart. I believe in compassion, and I do think a wealthy society has a moral obligation to  sure it's vulnerable populations aren't suffering. But even if you ’t share those values, I still think the case for a strong safety net is nigh self-evident. 


Here’s the basic idea: when the poorest people in a society have what they need to live with dignity, and when they have a real shot at improving their lives, not  as a social myth, that society becomes more stable. There’s less crime. Less unrest. Less chaos. This isn’t wishful thinking. It’s what history, economics, and common sense tell us. 

People who are starving, stuck in rundown housing, or trapped in hopeless poverty, especially in a country that prides itself on opportunity and wealth, ’t  quietly accept their lot. Some steal. Some riot. Some fall into addiction or despair. Others become radicalized. And no amount of police or gated communities can protect a society where millions feel like they have nothing left to lose.

Now look at the opposite: when people feel like they have enough to survive, to grow, and to build something of their own, or even  to be comfortable, they become stakeholders. They get invested in the success of the society around them. They’re less likely to loot your store or break into your car. Even if you’re wealthy, or doing fine–even if you're Gordon ""greed is good"" Gecko or some Ayn Randian captain of industry, it’s still in your interest to live in a world where people are hopeful instead of desperate. 

That’s where things like universal healthcare, good public schools, subsidized housing, or even universal basic income come in. Not as dreamy handouts, but as safety valves. A quality social net won't fix everything, but it will prevent millions of us from falling slipping through the cracks, or at the very least mitigate the worst consequences.

Some people believe welfare makes people lazy lazy. Maybe that's true in some cases, but if I'm not wrong statistically speaking that's easily disprovable as most who use welfare get off after a couple years. But let’s be honest, what kills motivation more than working two jobs and still falling behind? The best incentive is hope. The best fuel for ambition is the belief that if you try, you might actually get somewhere, and if you try and fail, a second chance isn't a miracle. 

So yeah, I care about the poor because I was one. But even if you ’t, even if you’re  trying to protect your neighborhood, your wallet, or your peace of mind, you should still want the people at the bottom to have food, shelter, a few modern conveniences, and a real chance at something .

EDIT: A lot of replies seem to miss the core of my argument.  to clarify:

1. I'm not debating logistics or cost. I'm not arguing about how we fund a safety net. I'm saying people should want one. If the political will existed, paying for it would be the easy part. Our defense budget is over 800 billion and we have a billionaire class that generates a comparable sum of wealth each year. The real issue is the lack of will, not the lack of money.

2. I'm not making a moral argument, so arguing the morals of it miss my point. I'm explicitly asking people to set aside ideology and values. The claim is that a strong safety net is rational self-interest. If you're not rich, it protects you from ruin if you lose your job or face a crisis. If you are rich, it helps prevent social collapse. History shows what  when inequality festers: unrest, populism, and yes, sometimes violence. Stability is in everyone's interest.

3. ""It makes people lazy"" is still a moral argument. You're appealing to a value judgment (virtue vs vice). But if you insist on this argument,  ask yourself this to  understand my point: would you rather a lazy person who’s housed, fed, and calm? Or a highly motivated person who sees crime as their only chance at a  life? It's a cynical comparison, but I'm making a cynical claim appealing to outcomes, not ideals.

4. If you're citing studies claiming welfare causes dysfunction, be honest, you're cherry-picking. The overwhelming trend in research shows that strong social safety nets reduce crime, improve health, and increase long-term productivity. In my opinion best argument against them is economic feasibility, but then see point one.

Poland will be having the first round of its presidential election, Portugal will having its legislative elections, and Romania will be having the second round of its presidential elections. Oh, and I guess you can all still argue about Eurovision or something, whatever.

**Poland:**

Poland is having the first round of its presidential election, held every 5 years. Incumbent president Andrej Duda is not eligible for re-election following his two terms. A member of the right wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, Duda stands in contrast to the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Civic Platform (PO), vetoing legislation aimed at reforming the Polish government after years of PiS rule. If no candidate reaches 50%, as is almost certain, a second round will be held on June 1st. Still, the results of this round, especially when compared with polling, may give as a good indicator as to how the next round will shape up.

The candidates:

Karol Nawrocki (PiS) - Hard right: PiS have chosen historian Karol Nawrocki as their candidate. If he wins the 2nd round, it might mark a third straight election victory. However, he faces an uphill battle as he is currently polling in at second place with around 26% of the vote, and is behind on all the second round polls.

Rafal Trzaskowski (PO) - Liberal/Centre-right: PO have chosen to re-rerun Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski as their candidate, same as in the 2020 he very narrowly lost to Duda. Known for being a liberal as mayor, he has run to the right especially on security and immigration for this election. This is the guy we want to win the 2nd round, but it is understandable for someone not satisfied with Tusk's government on issues like LGBT rights and abortion. Still, his win would mark a victory for a pro-European vision. He is currently polling at around 33%, and leads all the second round polls.

Sławomir Mentzen (Confederation) - Far right: Campaigning hard against the EU and immigration, far right candidate Sławomir Mentzen at one point appeared likely to surpass Nawrocki in the polls as the candidate for the Euroskeptic hard right. His party Confederation has been accused of promoting antisemitism and spread misinformation during the pandemic. Mentzen's support has since fallen from 18% to now 12% since he called for introducing student tuition fees and a total ban on all abortion including for rape.

The other candidates are all polling below 10% so I haven't included them here. I know at least some people here will be voting for someone other than Trzaskowski so anyone willing to give a similar summary feel free to tag me with it.

[Results](https://wybory.gov.pl/prezydent2025/en) \- Polls close at 9PM local time

**Portugal:**

Despite having elections just last year in March, due to a scandal surrounding Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, the Portuguese government fell apart two months ago. The scandal surrounded data protection firm Spinumviva, which is owned by his family, and the companies clients having government contracts. While Montenegro has denied any conflict of interest issues, the scandal nonetheless resulted in him losing a vote of no-confidence. His government was always on shaky grounds, in the last election his Democratic Alliance (AD) coalition - mostly made of the centre-right Social Democratic Party - only won 80 out of 230 seats against the 78 seats of the centre-left Socialist Party (PS). Yes, the names are pretty funny.

Currently, the results are set to be similar to the last election. AD are currently narrowly ahead of their 2024 vote totals with PS slightly behind with 32%-26% of the vote shares respectively. Coming in at 3rd place with around 18% of the vote are the far-right Chega, but AD have refused to coalition with them. Another AD minority government is likely, but if the Liberal Initiative party wins enough seats it is possible for a majority coalition government.

**Romania:**

First round of elections initially took place in November last year. Far right independent Călin Georgescu won out of nowhere with 23% off of mostly popularity on TikTok and allegations of Russian interference. Georgescu was a far-right candidate who has made certain... interesting claims including saying Pepsi contains microchips, the Romanian language came before Latin, Romania is the spiritual centre of the Earth and Jesus was resurrected so Romania could be humanity's guiding light, vaccines block our spiritual connection, women should be natural like deer, water (especially Romanian water) has spiritual properties, Romanian forests contain Earth's spirit energy, the moon landing was faked, and that he met with non-human species at Davos. Additionally, he is an admirer of dictator Ion Antonescu and the Iron Guard, fascists who were responsible for the massacre of Jews during WW2. Georgescu was the heavy favourite going into the second round.

Alas, the election results were annulled by the Romanian constitutional court after findings that Georgescu had lied about his campaign finances. This prompted protests and allegations of an electoral coup to prevent Georgescu's victory.

Georgescu was barred from running again in the second round, and new elections took place again on 4th May. Today's elections are the second round between the top two candidates of the first round.

The candidates:

George Simion (Alliance for the Union of Romanians - AUR) - Populist conservative, former activist with a long history of violence and once threatened a woman colleague with rape on the Parliament floor. Simion is running on an anti-establishment platform, is anti-vax, opposes all aid to Ukraine, and is a staunch Euroskeptic. Simion is backed by Georgescu, whom he claims will either make prime minister or president in his stead once he wins. He won the first round with a whopping 41% of the vote and was the clear favourite going into the election. However, Simion has been tainted with various campaign gaffes including promising to fire half a million government workers, calling his housing plan a strategy to win votes, and refusing further debates after having been wildly considered to have lost the first one. The race is now around neck-and-neck.

Nicusor Dan (independent) - This is our guy. Dan is the current mayor of Bucharest, centre-right, very pro-European, former activist and two times gold medalist at the international math olympics, elected in a landslide for his second term as mayor. Dan is running on a pro-European, pro-Ukrainian, moderate platform. He is buoyed by not being associated with Romania's hugely unpopular establishment. He won just 21% of the vote during the first round, but in addition to Simion's mistakes his chances have improved thanks to a space of endorsements from public figures, politicians, and almost all major TV stations.

Poland will be having the first  of its presidential election, Portugal will having its legislative elections, and Romania will be having the second  of its presidential elections. Oh, and I guess you can all still argue about Eurovision or something, whatever.

**Poland:**

Poland is having the first  of its presidential election, held every 5 years. Incumbent president Andrej Duda is not eligible for re-election following his two terms. A member of the right wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, Duda stands in contrast to the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Civic Platform (PO), vetoing legislation aimed at reforming the Polish government after years of PiS rule. If no candidate reaches 50%, as is almost certain, a second  will be held on June 1st. Still, the results of this , especially when compared with polling, may give as a good indicator as to how the next  will shape up.

The candidates:

Karol Nawrocki (PiS) - Hard right: PiS have chosen historian Karol Nawrocki as their candidate. If he wins the 2nd , it might mark a third straight election victory. However, he faces an uphill battle as he is currently polling in at second place with around 26% of the vote, and is behind on all the second  polls.

Rafal Trzaskowski (PO) - Liberal/Centre-right: PO have chosen to re-rerun Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski as their candidate, same as in the 2020 he very narrowly lost to Duda. Known for being a liberal as mayor, he has run to the right especially on security and immigration for this election. This is the guy we want to win the 2nd , but it is understandable for someone not satisfied with Tusk's government on issues like LGBT  and abortion. Still, his win would mark a victory for a -European vision. He is currently polling at around 33%, and leads all the second  polls.

Sławomir Mentzen (Confederation) - Far right: Campaigning hard against the EU and immigration, far right candidate Sławomir Mentzen at one point appeared likely to surpass Nawrocki in the polls as the candidate for the Euroskeptic hard right. His party Confederation has been accused of promoting antisemitism and spread misinformation during the pandemic. Mentzen's support has since fallen from 18% to now 12% since he called for introducing student tuition fees and a total ban on all abortion including for rape.

The other candidates are all polling below 10% so I haven't included them here. I know at least some people here will be voting for someone other than Trzaskowski so anyone willing to give a similar summary feel free to tag me with it.

**Portugal:**

Despite having elections  last year in March, due to a scandal surrounding Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, the Portuguese government fell apart two months ago. The scandal surrounded data protection firm Spinumviva, which is owned by his family, and the companies clients having government contracts. While Montenegro has denied any conflict of interest issues, the scandal nonetheless resulted in him losing a vote of no-confidence. His government was always on shaky grounds, in the last election his Democratic Alliance (AD) coalition - mostly made of the centre-right Social Democratic Party - only won 80 out of 230 seats against the 78 seats of the centre-left Socialist Party (PS). Yes, the names are pretty funny.

Currently, the results are set to be similar to the last election. AD are currently narrowly ahead of their 2024 vote totals with PS slightly behind with 32%-26% of the vote shares respectively. Coming in at 3rd place with around 18% of the vote are the far-right Chega, but AD have refused to coalition with them. Another AD minority government is likely, but if the Liberal Initiative party wins enough seats it is possible for a majority coalition government.

**Romania:**

First  of elections initially took place in November last year. Far right independent Călin Georgescu won out of nowhere with 23% off of mostly popularity on TikTok and allegations of Russian interference. Georgescu was a far-right candidate who has made certain... interesting claims including saying Pepsi contains microchips, the Romanian language came before Latin, Romania is the spiritual centre of the Earth and Jesus was resurrected so Romania could be humanity's guiding light, vaccines block our spiritual connection,  should be natural like deer, water (especially Romanian water) has spiritual properties, Romanian forests contain Earth's spirit energy, the moon landing was faked, and that he met with non- species at Davos. Additionally, he is an admirer of dictator Ion Antonescu and the Iron Guard, fascists who were responsible for the massacre of Jews during WW2. Georgescu was the heavy favourite going into the second .

Alas, the election results were annulled by the Romanian constitutional court after findings that Georgescu had lied about his campaign finances. This prompted protests and allegations of an electoral coup to prevent Georgescu's victory.

Georgescu was barred from running again in the second , and new elections took place again on 4th May. Today's elections are the second  between the top two candidates of the first .

The candidates:

George Simion (Alliance for the Union of Romanians - AUR) - Populist conservative, former activist with a long history of violence and once threatened a woman colleague with rape on the Parliament floor. Simion is running on an anti-establishment platform, is anti-vax, opposes all aid to Ukraine, and is a staunch Euroskeptic. Simion is backed by Georgescu, whom he claims will either make prime minister or president in his stead once he wins. He won the first  with a whopping 41% of the vote and was the clear favourite going into the election. However, Simion has been tainted with various campaign gaffes including promising to fire half a million government workers, calling his housing plan a strategy to win votes, and refusing further debates after having been wildly considered to have lost the first one. The race is now around neck-and-neck.

Nicusor Dan (independent) - This is our guy. Dan is the current mayor of Bucharest, centre-right, very -European, former activist and two times gold medalist at the international math olympics, elected in a landslide for his second term as mayor. Dan is running on a -European, -Ukrainian, moderate platform. He is buoyed by not being associated with Romania's hugely unpopular establishment. He won  21% of the vote during the first , but in addition to Simion's mistakes his chances have improved thanks to a space of endorsements from public figures, politicians, and almost all major TV stations.

“A 30-year-old mother and nurse was declared brain dead months ago, but she is still being kept alive because she’s pregnant. Now, her family has questions about Georgia’s heartbeat law and why they didn’t have a say in her care.

Adriana Smith, a registered nurse at Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital, was about 9 weeks pregnant when she started having bad headaches in February. The 30-year-old went to Northside Hospital for help but was released after being given medication, according to her mother, April Newkirk

“They gave her some medication, but they didn’t do any tests, didn’t do any CT scans. If they did, they would have caught it,” Newkirk said.

The next morning, Smith’s boyfriend noticed something was terribly wrong.

“She was gasping for air in her sleep, gargling. More than likely, it was blood,” Newkirk said.

Smith ended up being taken to the hospital where she worked. A CT scan revealed multiple blood clots in her brain. Unfortunately, there was nothing doctors could do, and Smith was declared brain dead.

…Now at 21 weeks gestation, the baby’s health is uncertain. Smith was moved to Emory Midtown on Tuesday, which doctors told the family is better equipped for obstetric care. The plan is to keep Smith alive until doctors believe the baby can survive outside the womb, likely at 32 weeks.

…More than 90 days later, Smith’s family, including her young son, is still by her side as she remains on life support, but they say they weren’t given any say in her case because of Georgia’s heartbeat law. The law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around 6 weeks into pregnancy.”


“In Smith’s case, the state’s heartbeat law created a legal gray area. There are limited exceptions, including for rape, incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Because Smith is brain dead and no longer considered at risk herself, her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability.

The family says doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.

“I think every woman should have the right to make their own decision, and if not, then their partner or their parents,” Newkirk said. “I’m not saying we would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy, but what I’m saying is we should have had a choice.”

Newkirk says she wants people to understand the human toll of Georgia’s law and the emotional weight of being stripped of medical decision-making during a crisis.”

“In Smith’s case, the state’s heartbeat law created a legal gray area. There are limited exceptions, including for rape, incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Because Smith is brain dead and no longer considered at risk herself, her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability.

The family says doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.

“I think every woman should have the right to make their own decision, and if not, then their partner or their parents,” Newkirk said. “I’m not saying we would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy, but what I’m saying is we should have had a choice.”

Newkirk says she wants people to understand the human toll of Georgia’s law and the emotional weight of being stripped of medical decision-making during a crisis.”

If not, how can we adjust the law to reflect our values? A snippet from Fox News for context:

“A 30-year-old mother and nurse was declared brain dead months ago, but she is still being kept alive because she’s pregnant. Now, her family has questions about Georgia’s heartbeat law and why they didn’t have a say in her care.

Adriana Smith, a registered nurse at Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital, was about 9 weeks pregnant when she started having bad headaches in February. The 30-year-old went to Northside Hospital for help but was released after being given medication, according to her mother, April Newkirk

“They gave her some medication, but they didn’t do any tests, didn’t do any CT scans. If they did, they would have caught it,” Newkirk said.

The next morning, Smith’s boyfriend noticed something was terribly wrong.

“She was gasping for air in her sleep, gargling. More than likely, it was blood,” Newkirk said.

Smith ended up being taken to the hospital where she worked. A CT scan revealed multiple blood clots in her brain. Unfortunately, there was nothing doctors could do, and Smith was declared brain dead.

…Now at 21 weeks gestation, the baby’s health is uncertain. Smith was moved to Emory Midtown on Tuesday, which doctors told the family is better equipped for obstetric care. The plan is to keep Smith alive until doctors believe the baby can survive outside the womb, likely at 32 weeks.

…More than 90 days later, Smith’s family, including her young son, is still by her side as she remains on life support, but they say they weren’t given any say in her case because of Georgia’s heartbeat law. The law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around 6 weeks into pregnancy.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1kjduy6/why_the_election_of_robert_prevost_as_pope_leo/,Abortion should be banned,Why the election of Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV is (probably) a win for Pope Francis' legacy and a defeat for the Catholic right,"By now, you've certainly seen the news: Robert Prevost became the first American to become the head of the Catholic Church. Taking the name Leo XIV, the new pope will certainly dominate at least a couple more news cycles as the interest in a Chicago-born pope continues for a few days.

If you've seen my other effortpost a few months back, you'll know that I took an interest in the subject of Francis' successor for a while. However, Prevost was not on my list of papabili. His name still comes as a shock to me, but admittedly his name was reported to have been increasingly gain traction by cardinals that wanted to continue Francis' legacy, according to some Catholic based media outlets .

In this effortpost, I'll go into Leo's background, and why I think he's a good bet for continuing the broad strokes of Francis' papacy: big focus on social and economic justice, while smacking down both conservatives within the church and right wing populists in the West.

#Leo's Background

Leo was born Robert Prevost in Chicago in 1955, to a father of French and Italian descent and a mother with some Creole and Afro-Haitian ancestry, among other things. He graduated from Villanova University in 1977 with a degree in mathmatics, and then was ordained a priest in 1982. He belongs to the Order of Saint Augustine, which has existed since the 1200s. Later in the 1980s, he began to increasingly be involved in the Augustinian mission in Peru, where he would remain for about a decade. In 2001 he became prior general of the Augustinians, making him their head. He would serve two six year terms in the role, being based in Rome but travelling the world to visit various Augustinian missions worldwide.

In 2014 Pope Francis picked him as the Bishop of Chiclayo, a city in northern Peru. He would remain there until 2023, when Francis named him the Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops. This is one of the most influential positions in the Vatican, as this department reviews candidates for new bishops and makes recommendations to the Pope (on paper the pope has the final say on all new bishops, but in practice he generally follows the Dicastery's suggestions). He was named a cardinal later that same year, initially as a cardinal-deacon but promoted to cardinal-bishop in January 2025.

Before Francis' death, Prevost was not on anyone's radar for a future pope. However, in the days between Francis' funeral and the 2025 conclave, he was named in some Catholic focused media outlets, such as The Pillar and National Catholic Reporter, as a name increasingly gaining traction among the cardinals. That being said, his American nationality was thought to be a major hurdle as the general line of thinking is that the cardinals are reluctant to pick a pope from the world's superpower, given the country's sheer dominance on the world stage and out of fear that an American pope would be likely to be drawn into the country's politics and culture wars, especially considering who the current POTUS and VP are. But his extensive time in Peru and Rome seems to have overcome these concerns, and the fact that he was elected in just four ballots suggests he had a strong showing from the first ballot and only gained votes from there.

#What signs are there that Leo XIV could be a pope similar to Francis?

There are three main things that I'm looking at that suggest Leo will be similar to the late Francis in at least some ways:his twitter account before becoming Pope, Leo's career during the Francis pontificate, and two key cardinals that are rumored to have supported Leo during the conclave votes.

#Prevost's Twitter history

Prior to becoming pope, Prevost/Leo maintained a twitter account called @drprevost as a bishop. He didn't tweet anything in 2024, but in 2025 tweeted five times. Two of these tweets were about Pope Francis' health, but the other three were criticisms of Trump and Vance. They were retweets of condemnations of the deportation of Kilmar Garcia and Vance's use of ""ordo amoris"" to justify caring less about immigrants than citizens. Notably, one of the latter retweets was from National Catholic Reporter,. or NCR.

NCR, as you might guess, focuses on Catholic related news, but isn't actually affilated with the Catholic Church due to being pretty left wing at times. Back in the late 60s, they published confidential reports showing that there was a lot of internal opposition to the publishing of Humanae Vitae (aka the RCC's current list of sexual no-no's that remains the standard to this day). So, not only did the new pope clearly condemn the Trump-Vance deportation agenda, he did so by at least once retweeting an article from a news source that represents the silent majority of left wing Catholics in the US, and one that has been even condemned as ""no true Catholic"" by a few bishops in America.

You think this might be a one-off where Prevost/Leo just happens to disagree on one thing with the new Trump administration, but there are even older retweets that suggest otherwise. These include retweeting Chris Murphy talking about gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, reposting outrage over the murder of George Floyd, and even more notably he's retweeted the Jesuit priest James Martin. Martin is well known within the Catholic world for perhaps being the RCC's most pro-LGBT cleric (while he's never outright called for gay marriage, everything else he says is very Episcopal sounding), to the point where right wing Catholics view him as a heretic. All of this, combined with the calling out of deportations, suggests someone who, if not a Democrat, clearly is disgusted by much of the social policy and cruelty of the Trump years, in line with Francis' statements during that time period. It's a clear difference with evangelicals and many right wing Catholics that are Trump supporters. While I expect Pope Leo to be cool and diplomatic with Trump and Vance, he'll likely take off the kid gloves when condemning right wing populism, like Francis before him.

#Prevost's career rise under Francis

The Prefect of the Dicastery of Bishops is, by it's very nature, one of the most powerful positions within the Vatican. Given how much religious authority a bishop has in his diocese, the person picking the men recommended for such positions is in a prime role to greatly influence the human resources policy and theological leanings of local churches around the world. Don't believe me? Look up both Robert McElroy and Raymond Burke and compare/contrast them. The former just got moved to the Archdiocese of Washington DC (almost certainly for the purpose of being a loud Trump critic for the next four years), while the former, a reactionary Benedict appointee, has been shut out of real influence for years but is a darling among the far right online Catholic community.

I cannot imagine Pope Francis, a man who was very progressive for a Catholic prelate and someone who tried to ""pack"" the College of Cardinals with men who supported his vision, would allow a secret conservative to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world. The previous prefect, Marc Ouellet, was a Benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a reward for delivering Francis the papacy in 2013. Ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75, and when he finally retired, I think Francis saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked Prevost out of Peru to carry it out.

The two past prefects, Giovanni Battista Re and Ouellet, were a seasoned Curia veteran and Archbishop of Quebec respectively. Both had experience running large church operations in prominent places. Leo, by contrast, was running a seemingly random diocese in Peru when called up by Francis. This suggests to me that Francis knew Leo's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be trusted to recommend bishop candidates that would carry out Francis' vision and spread his message around the world.

#Pierre and Cupich

Two notable cardinals in the Francis camp, per The Pillar, were arguing for votes to go Prevost's way before the conclave began: Christoph Pierre and Blase Cupich.

Born in France, Christoph Pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the United States (aka he's the Vatican's ambassador to the US). Before being assigned to DC in 2016, he was the nuncio to Mexico, and at the time the Mexican bishop's conference was considered to be among the most conservative in LATAM. Francis had a rough go with them in 2016 (google ""Francis rebukes Mexican bishops"" for more details). Pierre worked closely with Francis in ""dealing"" with them, and is generally thought to have done a good job as ambassador. After this, Francis reassigned him to DC, replacing the far right Carlo Vigano. Pierre now had the job of handling the infamously right wing USCCB and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country. (I should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they're stationed in, along with conducting interviews with people that know them, before passing on a shortlist of three names to the Dicastery of Bishops for their own decision-making.) Francis made the unusual move of giving Pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 (same year as Leo), and I suspect this was a reward for helping Francis in both America and Mexico.

Blase Cupich's supposed endorsement of Leo before the conclave, in my opinion and if true, is the single strongest piece of evidence that suggests to me that Leo will be a second Francis. Cupich is the current Archbishop of Chicago, but even before that he was showing signs of acting more like an Episcopalian than a Catholic. In Spokane, he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of Planned Parenthood (although he celebrated the overturning of Roe in 2022, like any Catholic bishop) and before that, in Rapid City, pushed back against the idea of denying Catholic Democrats the eucharist if they supported abortion. (Raymond Burke first brought up that idea over John Kerry being the Democratic nominee for president in 2004.)  As archbishop of Chicago, Cupich has eagerly gone after the Latin mass, supported gun control efforts, allowed his charity employees to help people register for health insurance under the ACA, pushed back against the USCCB's statement on Biden in 2020 (he said it ill-considered - I should mentioned it focused on abortion), and most notably delivered an invocation at the 2024 DNC. Given how much abortion rights were a major focus of Kamala Harris' campaign, conservative Catholics denounced Cupich doing this for reasons that don't need explaining. 

Cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to Francis, and supposedly had a say in the appointments of American bishops. For example, according to The Pillar he managed to get Cardinal McElroy the DC archdiocese, despite others making recommendations for moderate candidates. National Catholic Reporter also says that he and Prevost are close - probably a Chicago connection going on there, and I would assume Cupich first heard of Prevost not long after becoming Chicago's archbishop.

If one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the US was backing Prevost/Leo for the papacy, this had to have been a Francis continuity candidate in one form or fashion. I cannot imagine Cupich backing someone unless he was confident this candidate would continue most of Francis' agenda and theological focuses. Cupich isn't stupid enough to fall for a closeted conservative - it would be like Bush 41 nominating Souter for SCOTUS, and as we all know Souter turned out to be a liberal judge. As one of Francis' point men, Cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be willing to vote for, and Leo obviously made that list. The fact that Prevost was supposedly preferred as a ""Plan A"" over Tagle, a more obvious ""Francis continuity"" candidate, suggests that Prevost was comforably ""Francis-esque"" in Cupich's eyes.

#So what kind of pope will Leo XIV be?

This is the big question everyone is asking. Although Leo shares much in common with Francis, each pope tries to leave their own mark and blaze their own path. Benedict XVI, for example, was in some ways different in style and substance than John Paul II, despite being the latter's close advisor and a fellow conservative. I suspect Leo will be similar - following the broad strokes of the Francis papacy, while adding his own twist and style to it as he wishes.

Now, I don't expect Leo to be progressive right off the bat - he's on record opposing women deacons, is as anti-abortion as any Catholic prelate you can think of, and the onyl real record of him speaking on LGBT issues is from 2012, where he criticized support for ""homosexual lifestyles"" and from 2016, where he opposed Peruvian schools teaching about ""gender ideology"". However, it should be mentioned that Francis was opposed to Argentina's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 when he was an archbishop, and then became the pope most accomidating of LGBT people in history. Perhaps Prevost will be the same, over the course of many year of what could be a decade long pontificate or more.

In general, my current guess is that Leo will be slightly more conservative than Francis on gender and LGBT issues within the church. However, I expect him to go big on other issues Francis was popular in - immigration, fighting climate change, and social and economic justice. As a Peruvian bishop, Prevost/Leo strongly supported helping refugees from Venezuela arriving in the country, and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change, having said the church must move ""from words to action"" on the issue. The Leo XIV papacy will likely continue to move the RCC in the general direction that his predecessor began.

One other point I'd make, purely my guesswork and hypotheticals, is that I think Leo was voted for by at least a few of the progressive cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the USCCB for good. In most countries, the ""Bergoglian"" wing of the church is in command. The US is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case, probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning Roe and wanting to see abortion banned. The differences between the the American RCC and the RCC in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of people realize, and many loud critics of Francis came from American conservative Catholics. Francis made some steps to counter them (promoting Cupich and McElroy to the rank of cardinal, putting Prevost in the Dicastery of Bishops etc), but I suspect the real ""medicine"" will come with an American-born pope standing up to Trump's deportation cruelty on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall Bergoglian message. It'll be an interesting decade or so for Catholic politics and drama, no doubt.

Anyhow, let me know what you think of any of this.",Jokerang,neoliberal,In-favor,Abortion Laws,"Why the election of Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV is (probably) a win for Pope Francis' legacy and a defeat for the Catholic right By now, you've certainly seen the news: Robert Prevost became the first American to become the head of the Catholic Church. Taking the name Leo XIV, the new pope will certainly dominate at least a couple more news cycles as the interest in a Chicago-born pope continues for a few days.

If you've seen my other effortpost a few months back, you'll know that I took an interest in the subject of Francis' successor for a while. However, Prevost was not on my list of papabili. His name still comes as a shock to me, but admittedly his name was reported to have been increasingly gain traction by cardinals that wanted to continue Francis' legacy, according to some Catholic based media outlets .

In this effortpost, I'll go into Leo's background, and why I think he's a good bet for continuing the broad strokes of Francis' papacy: big focus on social and economic justice, while smacking down both conservatives within the church and right wing populists in the West.

#Leo's Background

Leo was born Robert Prevost in Chicago in 1955, to a father of French and Italian descent and a mother with some Creole and Afro-Haitian ancestry, among other things. He graduated from Villanova University in 1977 with a degree in mathmatics, and then was ordained a priest in 1982. He belongs to the Order of Saint Augustine, which has existed since the 1200s. Later in the 1980s, he began to increasingly be involved in the Augustinian mission in Peru, where he would remain for about a decade.

look up both robert mcelroy and raymond burke and compare/contrast them . the former just got moved to the archdiocese of washington dc ( almost certainly for the purpose of being a for the next four years ) , while the former , a benedict appointee , has been shut out of real influence for years but is a among the far online catholic community . i can not imagine pope francis , a man who was very for a catholic prelate and someone who tried to `` pack '' the college of cardinals with men who his vision , would allow a secret to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world . the previous prefect , marc ouellet , was a benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a for delivering francis the papacy in 2013. ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75 , and when he finally retired , i think francis saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked prevost out of peru to carry it out . the two past prefects , giovanni battista re and ouellet , were a curia veteran and archbishop of quebec respectively . both had experience running large church operations in places . leo , by contrast , was running a seemingly random diocese in peru when called up by francis . this suggests to me that francis knew leo 's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be to bishop candidates that would carry out francis ' vision and spread his message around the world . # pierre and cupich two notable cardinals in the francis camp , per the pillar , were arguing for votes to go prevost 's way before the conclave began : christoph pierre and blase cupich . born in france , christoph pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the united states ( aka he 's the vatican 's ambassador to the us ) . before being assigned to dc in 2016 , he was the nuncio to mexico , and at the time the mexican bishop 's conference was considered to be among the most in latam . francis had a go with them in 2016 ( google `` francis rebukes mexican bishops '' for more details ) . pierre closely with francis in `` dealing '' with them , and is generally thought to have done a job as ambassador . after this , francis reassigned him to dc , replacing the far carlo vigano . pierre now had the job of handling the wing usccb and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country . ( i should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they 're stationed in , along with conducting interviews with people that know them , before passing on a shortlist of three names to the dicastery of bishops for their own decision-making . ) francis made the move of giving pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 ( same year as leo ) , and i this was a for francis in both america and mexico . blase cupich 's supposed of leo before the conclave , in my opinion and if true , is the single piece of evidence that suggests to me that leo will be a second francis . cupich is the current archbishop of chicago , but even before that he was showing signs of acting more an episcopalian than a catholic . in spokane , he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of planned parenthood ( although he the overturning of roe in 2022 , any catholic bishop ) and before that , in city , pushed back against the idea of catholic democrats the eucharist if they abortion . ( raymond burke first brought up that idea over john kerry being the democratic nominee for president in 2004 . ) as archbishop of chicago , cupich has gone after the latin mass , gun control efforts , allowed his charity employees to help people register for health insurance under the aca , pushed back against the usccb 's statement on biden in 2020 ( he said it ill-considered - i should mentioned it focused on abortion ) , and most delivered an invocation at the 2024 dnc . given how much abortion rights were a major focus of kamala harris ' campaign , catholics denounced cupich doing this for reasons that do n't need explaining . cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to francis , and supposedly had a say in the appointments of american bishops . for example , according to the pillar he managed to get cardinal mcelroy the dc archdiocese , despite others making for moderate candidates . national catholic reporter also says that he and prevost are close - probably a chicago connection going on there , and i would assume cupich first heard of prevost not long after becoming chicago 's archbishop . if one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the us was backing prevost/leo for the papacy , this had to have been a francis candidate in one form or fashion . i can not imagine cupich backing someone unless he was this candidate would continue most of francis ' agenda and theological focuses . cupich is n't to for a closeted - it would be bush 41 nominating souter for scotus , and as we all know souter turned out to be a liberal judge . as one of francis ' point men , cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be to vote for , and leo obviously made that list . the fact that prevost was supposedly preferred as a `` plan a '' over tagle , a more obvious `` francis '' candidate , suggests that prevost was comforably `` francis-esque '' in cupich 's eyes . # so what kind of pope will leo xiv be ? this is the big question everyone is asking . although leo shares much in common with francis , each pope tries to leave their own mark and blaze their own path . benedict xvi , for example , was in some ways different in style and substance than john paul ii , despite being the latter 's close advisor and a fellow . i leo will be similar - following the broad strokes of the francis papacy , while adding his own and style to it as he wishes . now , i do n't expect leo to be off the bat - he 's on record opposing women deacons , is as anti-abortion as any catholic prelate you can think of , and the onyl real record of him speaking on lgbt is from 2012 , where he for `` homosexual lifestyles '' and from 2016 , where he opposed peruvian schools teaching about `` gender ideology '' . however , it should be mentioned that francis was opposed to argentina 's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 when he was an archbishop , and then became the pope most accomidating of lgbt people in history . perhaps prevost will be the same , over the course of many year of what could be a decade long pontificate or more . in general , my current guess is that leo will be slightly more than francis on gender and lgbt within the church . however , i expect him to go big on other francis was in - immigration , fighting climate change , and social and economic justice . as a peruvian bishop , prevost/leo strongly refugees from venezuela arriving in the country , and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change , having said the church must move `` from words to action '' on the . the leo xiv papacy will likely continue to move the rcc in the general direction that his predecessor began . one other point i 'd make , purely my guesswork and hypotheticals , is that i think leo was voted for by at least a few of the cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the usccb for . in most countries , the `` bergoglian '' wing of the church is in command . the us is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case , probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning roe and wanting to see abortion banned . the differences between the the american rcc and the rcc in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of people realize , and many of francis came from american catholics . francis made some steps to counter them ( promoting cupich and mcelroy to the rank of cardinal , putting prevost in the dicastery of bishops etc ) , but i the real `` medicine '' will come with an american-born pope standing up to 's deportation on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall bergoglian message . it 'll be an decade or so for catholic politics and drama , no . anyhow , let me know what you think of any of this .",Abortion Laws_In-favor,"Why the election of Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV is (probably) a win for Pope ' legacy and a defeat for the Catholic right By now, you've certainly seen the news: Robert Prevost became the first American to become the head of the Catholic Church. Taking the name Leo XIV, the new pope will certainly dominate at least a couple more news cycles as the interest in a Chicago-born pope continues for a few days.

If you've seen my other effortpost a few months back, you'll know that I took an interest in the subject of ' successor for a while. However, Prevost was not on my list of papabili. His name still comes as a shock to me, but admittedly his name was reported to have been increasingly gain traction by cardinals that wanted to continue ' legacy, according to some Catholic based media outlets .

In this effortpost, I'll go into Leo's background, and why I think he's a good bet for continuing the broad strokes of ' papacy: big focus on social and economic justice, while smacking down both conservatives within the church and right wing populists in the West.

#Leo's Background

Leo was born Robert Prevost in Chicago in 1955, to a father of French and Italian descent and a mother with some Creole and Afro-Haitian ancestry, among other things. He graduated from Villanova University in 1977 with a degree in mathmatics, and then was ordained a priest in 1982. He belongs to the Order of Saint Augustine, which has existed since the 1200s. Later in the 1980s, he began to increasingly be involved in the Augustinian mission in Peru, where he would remain for about a decade. In 2001 he became prior general of the Augustinians, making him their head. He would serve two six year terms in the role, being based in Rome but travelling the world to visit various Augustinian missions worldwide.

In 2014 Pope  picked him as the Bishop of Chiclayo, a city in northern Peru. He would remain there until 2023, when  named him the Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops. This is one of the most influential positions in the Vatican, as this department reviews candidates for new bishops and makes recommendations to the Pope (on paper the pope has the final say on all new bishops, but in practice he generally follows the Dicastery's suggestions). He was named a cardinal later that same year, initially as a cardinal-deacon but promoted to cardinal-bishop in January 2025.

Before ' death, Prevost was not on anyone's radar for a future pope. However, in the days between ' funeral and the 2025 conclave, he was named in some Catholic focused media outlets, such as The Pillar and National Catholic Reporter, as a name increasingly gaining traction among the cardinals. That being said, his American nationality was thought to be a major hurdle as the general line of thinking is that the cardinals are reluctant to pick a pope from the world's superpower, given the country's sheer dominance on the world stage and out of fear that an American pope would be likely to be drawn into the country's politics and culture wars, especially considering who the current POTUS and VP are. But his extensive time in Peru and Rome seems to have overcome these concerns, and the fact that he was elected in  four ballots suggests he had a strong showing from the first ballot and only gained votes from there.

#What signs are there that Leo XIV could be a pope similar to ?

There are three main things that I'm looking at that suggest Leo will be similar to the late  in at least some ways:his twitter account before becoming Pope, Leo's career during the  pontificate, and two key cardinals that are rumored to have supported Leo during the conclave votes.

#Prevost's Twitter history

Prior to becoming pope, Prevost/Leo maintained a twitter account called @drprevost as a bishop. He didn't tweet anything in 2024, but in 2025 tweeted five times. Two of these tweets were about Pope ' health, but the other three were criticisms of Trump and Vance. They were retweets of condemnations of the deportation of Kilmar Garcia and Vance's use of ""ordo amoris"" to justify caring less about immigrants than citizens. Notably, one of the latter retweets was from National Catholic Reporter,. or NCR.

NCR, as you might guess, focuses on Catholic related news, but isn't actually affilated with the Catholic Church due to being pretty left wing at times. Back in the late 60s, they published confidential reports showing that there was a lot of internal opposition to the publishing of Humanae Vitae (aka the RCC's current list of sexual no-no's that remains the standard to this day). So, not only did the new pope clearly condemn the Trump-Vance deportation agenda, he did so by at least once retweeting an article from a news source that represents the silent majority of left wing  in the US, and one that has been even condemned as ""no true Catholic"" by a few bishops in America.

You think this might be a one-off where Prevost/Leo  happens to disagree on one thing with the new Trump administration, but there are even older retweets that suggest otherwise. These include retweeting Chris Murphy talking about gun  in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, reposting outrage over the murder of George Floyd, and even more notably he's retweeted the Jesuit priest James Martin. Martin is well known within the Catholic world for perhaps being the RCC's most -LGBT cleric (while he's never outright called for gay marriage, everything else he says is very Episcopal sounding), to the point where right wing  view him as a heretic. All of this, combined with the calling out of deportations, suggests someone who, if not a Democrat, clearly is disgusted by much of the social policy and cruelty of the Trump years, in line with ' statements during that time period. It's a clear difference with evangelicals and many right wing  that are Trump supporters. While I expect Pope Leo to be cool and diplomatic with Trump and Vance, he'll likely take off the kid gloves when condemning right wing populism, like  before him.

#Prevost's career rise under 

The Prefect of the Dicastery of Bishops is, by it's very nature, one of the most powerful positions within the Vatican. Given how much religious authority a bishop has in his diocese, the person picking the men recommended for such positions is in a prime role to greatly influence the  resources policy and theological leanings of local churches around the world. 't believe me? Look up both Robert McElroy and Raymond Burke and compare/contrast them. The former  got moved to the Archdiocese of Washington DC (almost certainly for the purpose of being a loud Trump critic for the next four years), while the former, a reactionary Benedict appointee, has been shut out of real influence for years but is a darling among the far right online Catholic community.

I cannot imagine Pope , a man who was very progressive for a Catholic prelate and someone who tried to ""pack"" the College of Cardinals with men who supported his vision, would allow a secret conservative to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world. The previous prefect, Marc Ouellet, was a Benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a reward for delivering  the papacy in 2013. Ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75, and when he finally retired, I think  saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked Prevost out of Peru to carry it out.

The two past prefects, Giovanni Battista Re and Ouellet, were a seasoned Curia veteran and Archbishop of Quebec respectively. Both had experience running large church operations in prominent places. Leo, by contrast, was running a seemingly random diocese in Peru when called up by . This suggests to me that  knew Leo's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be trusted to recommend bishop candidates that would carry out ' vision and spread his message around the world.

#Pierre and Cupich

Two notable cardinals in the  camp, per The Pillar, were arguing for votes to go Prevost's way before the conclave began: Christoph Pierre and Blase Cupich.

Born in France, Christoph Pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the United States (aka he's the Vatican's ambassador to the US). Before being assigned to DC in 2016, he was the nuncio to Mexico, and at the time the Mexican bishop's conference was considered to be among the most conservative in LATAM.  had a rough go with them in 2016 (google "" rebukes Mexican bishops"" for more details). Pierre worked closely with  in ""dealing"" with them, and is generally thought to have done a good job as ambassador. After this,  reassigned him to DC, replacing the far right Carlo Vigano. Pierre now had the job of handling the infamously right wing USCCB and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country. (I should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they're stationed in, along with conducting interviews with people that know them, before passing on a shortlist of three names to the Dicastery of Bishops for their own decision-making.)  made the unusual move of giving Pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 (same year as Leo), and I suspect this was a reward for helping  in both America and Mexico.

Blase Cupich's supposed endorsement of Leo before the conclave, in my opinion and if true, is the single strongest piece of evidence that suggests to me that Leo will be a second . Cupich is the current Archbishop of Chicago, but even before that he was showing signs of acting more like an Episcopalian than a Catholic. In Spokane, he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of Planned Parenthood (although he celebrated the overturning of Roe in 2022, like any Catholic bishop) and before that, in Rapid City, pushed back against the idea of denying Catholic  the eucharist if they supported abortion. (Raymond Burke first brought up that idea over John Kerry being the Democratic nominee for president in 2004.)  As archbishop of Chicago, Cupich has eagerly gone after the Latin mass, supported gun  efforts, allowed his charity employees to help people register for health insurance under the ACA, pushed back against the USCCB's statement on Biden in 2020 (he said it ill-considered - I should mentioned it focused on abortion), and most notably delivered an invocation at the 2024 DNC. Given how much abortion  were a major focus of Kamala Harris' campaign, conservative  denounced Cupich doing this for reasons that 't need explaining. 

Cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to , and supposedly had a say in the appointments of American bishops. For example, according to The Pillar he managed to get Cardinal McElroy the DC archdiocese, despite others making recommendations for moderate candidates. National Catholic Reporter also says that he and Prevost are close - probably a Chicago connection going on there, and I would assume Cupich first heard of Prevost not long after becoming Chicago's archbishop.

If one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the US was backing Prevost/Leo for the papacy, this had to have been a  continuity candidate in one form or fashion. I cannot imagine Cupich backing someone unless he was confident this candidate would continue most of ' agenda and theological focuses. Cupich isn't stupid enough to fall for a closeted conservative - it would be like Bush 41 nominating Souter for SCOTUS, and as we all know Souter turned out to be a liberal judge. As one of ' point men, Cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be willing to vote for, and Leo obviously made that list. The fact that Prevost was supposedly preferred as a ""Plan A"" over Tagle, a more obvious "" continuity"" candidate, suggests that Prevost was comforably ""-esque"" in Cupich's eyes.

#So what kind of pope will Leo XIV be?

This is the big question everyone is asking. Although Leo shares much in common with , each pope tries to leave their own mark and blaze their own path. Benedict XVI, for example, was in some ways different in style and substance than John Paul II, despite being the latter's close advisor and a fellow conservative. I suspect Leo will be similar - following the broad strokes of the  papacy, while adding his own twist and style to it as he wishes.

Now, I 't expect Leo to be progressive right off the bat - he's on record opposing  deacons, is as anti-abortion as any Catholic prelate you can think of, and the onyl real record of him speaking on LGBT issues is from 2012, where he criticized support for ""homosexual lifestyles"" and from 2016, where he opposed Peruvian schools teaching about ""gender ideology"". However, it should be mentioned that  was opposed to Argentina's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 when he was an archbishop, and then became the pope most accomidating of LGBT people in history. Perhaps Prevost will be the same, over the course of many year of what could be a decade long pontificate or more.

In general, my current guess is that Leo will be slightly more conservative than  on gender and LGBT issues within the church. However, I expect him to go big on other issues  was popular in - immigration, fighting climate change, and social and economic justice. As a Peruvian bishop, Prevost/Leo strongly supported helping refugees from Venezuela arriving in the country, and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change, having said the church must move ""from words to action"" on the issue. The Leo XIV papacy will likely continue to move the RCC in the general direction that his predecessor began.

One other point I'd make, purely my guesswork and hypotheticals, is that I think Leo was voted for by at least a few of the progressive cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the USCCB for good. In most countries, the ""Bergoglian"" wing of the church is in command. The US is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case, probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning Roe and wanting to see abortion banned. The differences between the the American RCC and the RCC in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of people realize, and many loud critics of  came from American conservative .  made some steps to counter them (promoting Cupich and McElroy to the rank of cardinal, putting Prevost in the Dicastery of Bishops etc), but I suspect the real ""medicine"" will come with an American-born pope standing up to Trump's deportation cruelty on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall Bergoglian message. It'll be an interesting decade or so for Catholic politics and drama, no doubt.

look up both robert mcelroy and raymond burke and compare/contrast them . the former  got moved to the archdiocese of washington dc ( almost certainly for the purpose of being a for the next four years ) , while the former , a benedict appointee , has been shut out of real influence for years but is a among the far online catholic community . i can not imagine pope  , a man who was very for a catholic prelate and someone who tried to `` pack '' the college of cardinals with men who his vision , would allow a secret to be in charge of the department recommending to him new bishops around the world . the previous prefect , marc ouellet , was a benedict holdover almost certainly kept on as a for delivering  the papacy in 2013. ouellet stayed on past the usual retirement age of 75 , and when he finally retired , i think  saw his chance to put someone more in line with his agenda and plucked prevost out of peru to carry it out . the two past prefects , giovanni battista re and ouellet , were a curia veteran and archbishop of quebec respectively . both had experience running large church operations in places . leo , by contrast , was running a seemingly random diocese in peru when called up by  . this suggests to me that  knew leo 's theology was fundamentally in line with his own and therefore could be to bishop candidates that would carry out  ' vision and spread his message around the world . # pierre and cupich two notable cardinals in the  camp , per the pillar , were arguing for votes to go prevost 's way before the conclave began : christoph pierre and blase cupich . born in france , christoph pierre is currently the apostolic nuncio to the united states ( aka he 's the vatican 's ambassador to the us ) . before being assigned to dc in 2016 , he was the nuncio to mexico , and at the time the mexican bishop 's conference was considered to be among the most in latam .  had a go with them in 2016 ( google ``  rebukes mexican bishops '' for more details ) . pierre closely with  in `` dealing '' with them , and is generally thought to have done a job as ambassador . after this ,  reassigned him to dc , replacing the far carlo vigano . pierre now had the job of handling the wing usccb and getting more moderates and liberals in bishoprics across the country . ( i should note that a nuncio does background checks on potential bishops for openings in the country they 're stationed in , along with conducting interviews with people that know them , before passing on a shortlist of three names to the dicastery of bishops for their own decision-making . )  made the move of giving pierre the red hat of a cardinal in 2023 ( same year as leo ) , and i this was a for  in both america and mexico . blase cupich 's supposed of leo before the conclave , in my opinion and if true , is the single piece of evidence that suggests to me that leo will be a second  . cupich is the current archbishop of chicago , but even before that he was showing signs of acting more an episcopalian than a catholic . in spokane , he advised his priests against demonstrating in front of planned parenthood ( although he the overturning of roe in 2022 , any catholic bishop ) and before that , in city , pushed back against the idea of catholic  the eucharist if they abortion . ( raymond burke first brought up that idea over john kerry being the democratic nominee for president in 2004 . ) as archbishop of chicago , cupich has gone after the latin mass , gun  efforts , allowed his charity employees to help people register for health insurance under the aca , pushed back against the usccb 's statement on biden in 2020 ( he said it ill-considered - i should mentioned it focused on abortion ) , and most delivered an invocation at the 2024 dnc . given how much abortion  were a major focus of kamala harris ' campaign ,  denounced cupich doing this for reasons that do n't need explaining . cupich is also generally thought to have had a direct line to  , and supposedly had a say in the appointments of american bishops . for example , according to the pillar he managed to get cardinal mcelroy the dc archdiocese , despite others making for moderate candidates . national catholic reporter also says that he and prevost are close - probably a chicago connection going on there , and i would assume cupich first heard of prevost not long after becoming chicago 's archbishop . if one of the most liberal cardinals/bishops in the us was backing prevost/leo for the papacy , this had to have been a  candidate in one form or fashion . i can not imagine cupich backing someone unless he was this candidate would continue most of  ' agenda and theological focuses . cupich is n't to for a closeted - it would be bush 41 nominating souter for scotus , and as we all know souter turned out to be a liberal judge . as one of  ' point men , cupich almost certainly had a shortlist of potential popes he would be to vote for , and leo obviously made that list . the fact that prevost was supposedly preferred as a `` plan a '' over tagle , a more obvious ``  '' candidate , suggests that prevost was comforably `` -esque '' in cupich 's eyes . # so what kind of pope will leo xiv be ? this is the big question everyone is asking . although leo shares much in common with  , each pope tries to leave their own mark and blaze their own path . benedict xvi , for example , was in some ways different in style and substance than john paul ii , despite being the latter 's close advisor and a fellow . i leo will be similar - following the broad strokes of the  papacy , while adding his own and style to it as he wishes . now , i do n't expect leo to be off the bat - he 's on record opposing  deacons , is as anti-abortion as any catholic prelate you can think of , and the onyl real record of him speaking on lgbt is from 2012 , where he for `` homosexual lifestyles '' and from 2016 , where he opposed peruvian schools teaching about `` gender ideology '' . however , it should be mentioned that  was opposed to argentina 's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 when he was an archbishop , and then became the pope most accomidating of lgbt people in history . perhaps prevost will be the same , over the course of many year of what could be a decade long pontificate or more . in general , my current guess is that leo will be slightly more than  on gender and lgbt within the church . however , i expect him to go big on other  was in - immigration , fighting climate change , and social and economic justice . as a peruvian bishop , prevost/leo strongly refugees from venezuela arriving in the country , and is outspoken on the need to fight climate change , having said the church must move `` from words to action '' on the . the leo xiv papacy will likely continue to move the rcc in the general direction that his predecessor began . one other point i 'd make , purely my guesswork and hypotheticals , is that i think leo was voted for by at least a few of the cardinals in part as a way of dealing with the usccb for . in most countries , the `` bergoglian '' wing of the church is in command . the us is easily the highest profile country where this is not the case , probably due to years of allying with evangelicals over their common goal of overturning roe and wanting to see abortion banned . the differences between the the american rcc and the rcc in much of the rest of the world are bigger than a lot of people realize , and many of  came from american  .  made some steps to counter them ( promoting cupich and mcelroy to the rank of cardinal , putting prevost in the dicastery of bishops etc ) , but i the real `` medicine '' will come with an american-born pope standing up to 's deportation on the world stage and internally continuing to promote bishops that promote the overall bergoglian message . it 'll be an decade or so for catholic politics and drama , no . anyhow , let me know what you think of any of this ."

Their pro big business and aren't that much different from Republicans. They won't enact all the socialist policies. This is the main reason cited for them being too centrist. 

But to make up for this they are the most left wing party in the world on cultural issues. Keeping schools shut until 2022 in some places was something only Democrats did. No other country, yes even the super progressive European ones that you like, kept schools closed beyond 2020. This, by the way is why Democrats lost a generation of young people. You locked them inside for 2 years during their most formative years. Every left party across the developed world, including the super left ones agrees that you should provide identification when you vote. Only the American left opposes IDs by screaming BLACK PEOPLE ARE TOO DUMB TO GET AN ID!

When some states were passing 15 week abortion bans, the left screeched about the Handmaiden's Tale. This ignores that time period covers most abortions. It becomes very unpopular after that time period. It also is in no way out of the norm. You'd be surprised how many European countries have stricter abortion laws. In Ireland, Norway and Denmark for example, they have a 12 week ban. Finally all the social issues. ACAB. Abolish ICE. Men can get pregnant. Being on time is racist. Dozens of other batshit insane things. They're all to certain extend supported or are allowed to prosper in the DNC. That's why people say it's too far left. I think eliminating this and doing nothing else would make Democrats much more popular. Obviously, great policy would be even more so, but baby steps.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1knrao3/how_prolife_arguments_contradict/,Abortion should be banned,How Pro-Life Arguments Contradict,"I’m honestly sick of how pro-life arguments keep changing every time someone points out their flaws. It’s like they can’t stick to one consistent reason for banning abortion because none of their reasons actually hold up under scrutiny. So they jump from one excuse to another, each one undermining the last, until they’re left arguing in circles. Let me walk you through the mess, because the logic they claim to stand on is pure hypocrisy.

The favorite go-to is always this: “Abortion is wrong because it kills an innocent human life.” On the surface, that sounds serious and important — who could argue with protecting innocent life? Except that when you look closer, this argument makes no sense at all unless you’re willing to take away bodily autonomy from everyone who ever needs help from another person’s body. If the right to life trumps everything, then any person who needs an organ transplant or a blood transfusion should be able to force someone else to give it to them. But surprise — we don’t force organ or blood donations. That would be an outrageous violation of bodily autonomy. So if pro-lifers really cared about innocent human life above all else, they’d be fighting to make organ donation mandatory, too. But they don’t. They only care about forced pregnancy. So the “right to life” excuse is a lie they lean on until challenged, then they pivot.

When you call out this hypocrisy, suddenly the “right to life” argument gets replaced with a “responsibility” or “culpability” argument. The new line is: “You’re responsible for the fetus because you chose to have sex, so you have to carry the pregnancy.” This is where the logic really falls apart. First off, implantation — the moment when an embryo attaches to the uterus — is not something a pregnant person consciously does or can control. It’s a biological process happening at the cellular level. If the embryo’s cells can’t be held responsible for their own actions, why should the pregnant person be blamed for a process they didn’t choose or cause directly? By that logic, if the embryo isn’t culpable, the pregnant person’s own body shouldn’t be either for processes like ovulation or fertilization, which they also can’t consciously control. Yet suddenly, because of a vague idea of “choice,” the pregnant person is expected to bear the full burden.

Then comes the tired, and frankly insulting, “you chose to have sex, so you chose pregnancy” line. This is so grossly oversimplified it ignores so many realities: sex isn’t always consensual, birth control isn’t foolproof, and accidents happen. Even if you accept that sex was consensual and “planned,” that doesn’t mean the pregnant person forfeited their bodily autonomy or that the government can force them to carry a pregnancy against their will. No one should be forced to pay for the consequences of someone else’s sperm just because they “allowed” sex to happen. If that logic worked, then every time you indirectly cause harm — like being a passenger in a reckless driver’s car — you’d be legally responsible for the outcome. But we don’t hold people accountable like that. So why hold pregnant people accountable for something as complex as conception and pregnancy?

Some pro-lifers try to argue that the fetus is a person with rights from the moment of conception, but science and philosophy don’t support that black-and-white claim. At what point does a cluster of cells become a “person”? Is it at fertilization? Implantation? When the heart starts beating? When the brain develops? Pro-lifers pick whatever point suits their agenda without consistent reasoning. If the fetus has a right to life before it can feel pain or survive outside the womb, what about people who are unconscious, in coma, or otherwise unable to function independently? The logic fails when you apply it universally, which means it’s a special exemption carved out just for pregnancy.

Another favorite tactic is to equate abortion with murder, or even worse, to compare it to the Holocaust or slavery. This is not only a cheap emotional ploy, it’s deeply offensive. It trivializes actual historic atrocities and ignores that abortion restrictions disproportionately harm marginalized groups, including Black and Brown women — the descendants of enslaved people and genocide survivors. The irony here is brutal. People who claim to defend “innocent life” are actually supporting laws that perpetuate systemic oppression and violence against the very groups that have historically suffered the most. That hypocrisy speaks volumes about what’s really driving their stance.

The reality is that anti-abortion laws are about control — control over women’s bodies, over people’s futures, over who gets to have autonomy and who doesn’t. If they were truly about “protecting life,” they’d be fighting poverty, lack of healthcare, domestic violence, and every other factor that threatens actual living humans. But they don’t. Instead, they focus on punishing and policing pregnant people, particularly women, for their reproductive choices. It’s a power play disguised as moral outrage.

If you want to talk about responsibility and consequences, fine. But forcing someone to risk their physical and mental health, their education, their job, their financial stability, and even their life to carry a pregnancy is not responsibility. It’s punishment. It’s cruelty.

At the end of the day, no argument against abortion holds up if you respect basic human rights and bodily autonomy. If a person doesn’t want to be pregnant, forcing them to stay pregnant is a violent violation of their freedom. If the pro-life movement actually cared about life, they’d support comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, and social services that help families thrive — not bans that put people in harm’s way.

So yeah, all these shifting justifications and backpedaling prove one thing: the anti-abortion argument isn’t about logic or ethics. It’s about control, about ideology, and about fear. And until that truth is faced head-on, their so-called “reasons” will keep crumbling under even the slightest scrutiny.

by that logic , if the embryo isn ’ t , the pregnant person ’ s own body shouldn ’ t be either for processes ovulation or fertilization , which they also can ’ t consciously  . yet suddenly , because of a idea of “ choice , ” the pregnant person is expected to bear the full . then comes the , and frankly , “ you chose to have sex , so you chose pregnancy ” line . this is so it ignores so many realities : sex isn ’ t always consensual ,   isn ’ t , and accidents happen . even if you accept that sex was consensual and “ planned , ” that doesn ’ t mean the pregnant person forfeited their bodily autonomy or that the government can force them to carry a pregnancy against their will . no one should be forced to pay for the consequences of someone else ’ s sperm  because they “ allowed ” sex to happen . if that logic , then every time you indirectly cause — being a passenger in a driver ’ s car — you ’ d be legally responsible for the outcome . but we don ’ t hold people accountable that . so why hold pregnant people accountable for something as as conception and pregnancy ? some -lifers try to argue that the fetus is a person with  from the moment of conception , but science and philosophy don ’ t that black-and-white claim . at what point does a cluster of cells become a “ person ” ? is it at fertilization ? implantation ? when the heart starts beating ? when the brain develops ? -lifers pick whatever point suits their agenda without reasoning . if the fetus has a to life before it can feel or survive outside the womb , what about people who are unconscious , in coma , or otherwise to function independently ? the logic when you apply it universally , which means it ’ s a special exemption carved out  for pregnancy . another tactic is to equate abortion with , or even , to compare it to the holocaust or slavery . this is not only a emotional , it ’ s deeply . it trivializes actual historic and ignores that abortion restrictions disproportionately marginalized groups , including black and brown  — the descendants of enslaved people and survivors . the here is . people who claim to defend “ innocent life ” are actually laws that perpetuate systemic and violence against the very groups that have historically the most . that speaks volumes about what ’ s really driving their stance . the reality is that anti-abortion laws are about  —  over  ’ s bodies , over people ’ s futures , over who gets to have autonomy and who doesn ’ t . if they were truly about “ protecting life , ” they ’ d be fighting , of  , domestic violence , and every other factor that threatens actual living humans . but they don ’ t . instead , they focus on punishing and policing pregnant people , particularly  , for their reproductive choices . it ’ s a power play disguised as moral . if you want to talk about responsibility and consequences , . but forcing someone to their physical and mental health , their education , their job , their financial , and even their life to carry a pregnancy is not responsibility . it ’ s punishment . it ’ s . at the end of the day , no argument against abortion holds up if you basic   and bodily autonomy . if a person doesn ’ t want to be pregnant , forcing them to stay pregnant is a of their . if the -life movement actually cared about life , they ’ d sex education , contraception , and social services that help families — not bans that put people in ’ s way . so yeah , all these shifting justifications and backpedaling prove one thing : the anti-abortion argument isn ’ t about logic or ethics . it ’ s about  , about ideology , and about . and until that truth is faced head-on , their so-called “ reasons ” will keep under even the slightest scrutiny ."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1kngz1x/why_do_justifications_against_abortion_keep/,Abortion should be banned,Why Do Justifications Against Abortion Keep Shifting and Undermining Each Other?,"I’ve noticed a recurring pattern in debates with people who want abortion banned, and I’m genuinely curious to understand the reasoning behind it.

The most common justification I hear is this: abortion should be banned because it ends the life of an innocent human being (the fetus), and innocent humans have a right to life, even if that means accessing someone else’s organs to survive.

But when I challenge that by pointing out that other innocent human beings (like would-be organ recipients) will also die if they can’t access another’s body, and yet we don’t force organ donation, the justification shifts. 

Suddenly, it’s not just about the innocence or the dying; it becomes about culpability. The pregnant woman’s is allegedly responsible for the fetus’s need and therefore obligated to meet it.

When that’s challenged by pointing out that implantation is something the embryo does - not the pregnant woman - the justification shifts again. Now it’s that no one is culpable for the biochemical actions of their cells. This conveniently re-centers the original “innocent life” argument that had just been abandoned when culpability was introduced.

But if the embryo is not culpable for its cellular actions - like implantation - then the pregnant person should also not be culpable for her own cellular processes, such as ovulation and fertilization, which she cannot directly control in the way the man controls an action like insemination. 

The logic applied to the embryo’s innocence applies equally to her. Yet rather than follow that symmetry, the argument often pivots again. Now it’s that she’s still responsible because she allowed the sex that introduced the catalyst. This introduces a new standard - indirect cause equals direct obligation - which once again abandons the prior standard of innocence as sufficient grounds for a right to use someone’s body.

When I then apply that standard more broadly (say, to passengers in a car accident who didn’t stop a reckless driver) the argument pivots again. 

Now it’s that indirect actions don’t make someone culpable, and thus they’re not obligated to provide support or restitution. This completely undermines the previous culpability argument by swinging us back around to the original “innocent life” framework.

And round and round it goes. Inevitably, it always seems to circle back to the decision to have sex, which ultimately falls flat, because the decision to negligent with their ejaculate is not a decision SHE makes (as if men are just mindless with no independent agency of their own - which, by the way, is a deeply insulting framing for men).

This constant rotation of justifications, where each new one undermines the last, and each challenge causes a retreat to a previously discarded argument, leaves me wondering: is any of this the actual reason people oppose abortion? Or is the fetus functioning as a rhetorical stand-in, masking a deeper, more emotionally or culturally rooted motive that isn’t being openly acknowledged?

I’m open to hearing sincere clarifications or justifications that remain consistent when applied universally.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1kr42ax/how_will_plers_address_these_rebuttals_and/,Abortion should be banned,How will PLers address these rebuttals and arguments?,">A fetus is an innocent life which deserves the right to live. Abortion is killing it and considered murder.

1. Right to live is part of human rights. Human rights by definition means *rights we have simply because we exist as* ***human beings*** \- they are not granted by any state according to the ohchr. Human beings are defined by a man, woman, or child of the species *Homo sapiens*, distinguished from other animals by **superior mental development**, power of articulate speech, and uprightstance. A fetus does not posses any of these qualities, thus it is not a human being, and therefore it has no human rights. (**first prove)**

EDIT: Considering some PLers are confused, first prove doesn’t always apply on every human being (eg for disabled ppl, they are still mentally superior than animals by a long shot though), thus I included the SECOND PROVE, yet, fetuses are NOT DISABLED (pretty much the only exemption for prove one), so rule one still applies.

2. No human being completely lacks consciousness/ breathing abilities/ digestive abilities on their own except, well, a corpse.  Thus, a fetus is not a human being. (**second prove**), once again, human rights fail to apply.
3. Abortion does not intentionally kill a fetus. Abortion involves a shed in uterus lining, which does not directly harm the fetus. The fetus dies because of its inherent disability to survive on its own. Thus, the **fetus'  inability despite not being attacked by external factors (e.g. sicknesses) killed itself, not abortion.**

* Hypothetical: Imagine the case of conjoined twins where there is only one heart, you know one must die. If you choose to perform the surgery to seperate them in order to enhance at least one of their quality of life, is it considered murder? No. The other twin inherently does not have the ability to survive.

1. Right to live does not equate to right to use someone's body to live without their consent.

>Consent to sex is consent to pregnancy. Pregnancy is caused by the choices and behaviours of women except SA cases.

1. Consent to an action does not equate to consent to the potential consequences.

* Hypothetical: You walk onto the streets (maybe at night) every single day with the potential consequences of murder and kidnapping. Does consent to walking on the streets equate to consent to being murdered/ kidnapped? No. Even though the chance is slim (exactly the case for sex with protection), it might still happen. Yet, you can still sue the criminal and gain justice. And people won't go around saying ""You deserved it"".  If consenting to an action that may or may not lead to a harmful result does not mean consenting to those results, what makes pregnancy any different?

2. You talked about ""parents"". But no, only **a parent** is involved here. It is biologically impossible for males to make the same contributions/ take the same responsibility as the female. The female actively suffers through metabolic changes, damage to organs, a risk of death, extreme pain, postpartum complications like depression etc etc etc.

1. Adoption causes life-long impacts for the child. *Each year*, approximately between 18,000-20,000 *children* ""age out"" of the U.S. foster care system without being *adopted*. Children who are orphans and without parents are more likely to have severe mental health issues as they feel unwanted and lonely.

# My arguments:

**Abortion supports body autonomy:** With the above rebuttals which proved fetuses are in fact, not human beings and do not have the right to use others' bodies, ""**my body my choice"" can be completely justified morally and legally.**

**Abortion supports feminism and encouraged the idea that women are independent:** Abortions show women that they **have a choice,** they are in charge of their own bodies and are not mere vessels for pregnancies. They are living breathing humans with the right to choose and **remove unwanted materials from the inside of their bodies.**

**Abortion prevents further sufferings:** abortions prevent the women from going through an unwanted pregnancy, an excruciatingly painful birth and possible complications as well as mental health issues, it also prevents the child from growing up in a place of neglect, poverty, and possible abuse.

**We cannot force kids to have kids:** sure, they made a mistake. But that does not mean we can punish them with lifelong consequences **both in terms of health** (teenagers face a much higher risk in pregnancies because their bodies are technically not fully ready) **and in terms of their futures.**

* Hypothetical: If a child cheated in a single test, will you ban them from all future exams? No. You will merely educate them and not punish them with irreversible consequences.

**Abortion are the one and only fix for rape victims and people who lack financial security:** one, it doesn't force them to relive the trauma. Two, people in extreme poverty absolutely cannot sustain a child's quality of life or even livelihood for that matter.

**A fetus doesn't feel any pain or have any memories:** A fetus does not have a developed mind and is not self-concious/aware.

**If males do not (or cannot) go through pregnancy, why should females if they don't want to?:** It is unfair for this standard to only be imposed on women, women should be given the opportunity to not go through pregnancy and not be limited to what they are capable of biologically.

P.S: I'd appreciate it if PLers can make **factual and scientific** claims that are backed up by actual evidence and reports. Such reports should ideally be conducted **on humans or at the very least mammals** and not plants/ sea lettuce like another report linked by previous PLers.",Practical_Fun4723,Abortiondebate,In-favor,Abortion Laws,"How will PLers address these rebuttals and arguments? >A fetus is an innocent life which deserves the right to live. Abortion is killing it and considered murder.

1. Right to live is part of human rights. Human rights by definition means *rights we have simply because we exist as* ***human beings*** \- they are not granted by any state according to the ohchr. Human beings are defined by a man, woman, or child of the species *Homo sapiens*, distinguished from other animals by **superior mental development**, power of articulate speech, and uprightstance. A fetus does not posses any of these qualities, thus it is not a human being, and therefore it has no human rights. (**first prove)**

EDIT: Considering some PLers are confused, first prove doesn’t always apply on every human being (eg for disabled ppl, they are still mentally superior than animals by a long shot though), thus I included the SECOND PROVE, yet, fetuses are NOT DISABLED (pretty much the only exemption for prove one), so rule one still applies.

2. No human being completely lacks consciousness/ breathing abilities/ digestive abilities on their own except, well, a corpse.  Thus, a fetus is not a human being. (**second prove**), once again, human rights fail to apply.
3. Abortion does not intentionally kill a fetus. Abortion involves a shed in uterus lining, which does not directly harm the fetus. The fetus dies because of its inherent disability to survive on its own. Thus, the **fetus'  inability despite not being attacked by external factors (e.g. sicknesses) killed itself, not abortion.**

* Hypothetical: Imagine the case of conjoined twins where there is only one heart, you know one must die. If you choose to perform the surgery to seperate them in order to enhance at least one of their quality of life, is it considered murder? No. The other twin inherently does not have the ability to survive.

1. Right to live does not equate to right to use someone's body to live without their consent.

>Consent to sex is consent to pregnancy. Pregnancy is caused by the choices and behaviours of women except SA cases.

1. Consent to an action does not equate to consent to the potential consequences.

* Hypothetical: You walk onto the streets (maybe at night) every single day with the potential consequences of murder and kidnapping. Does consent to walking on the streets equate to consent to being murdered/ kidnapped? No. Even though the chance is slim (exactly the case for sex with protection), it might still happen. Yet, you can still sue the criminal and gain justice. And people won't go around saying ""You deserved it"".  If consenting to an action that may or may not lead to a harmful result does not mean consenting to those results, what makes pregnancy any different?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1l2irai/why_cant_we_just_copy_paste_what_successful/,Abortion should be banned,Why can’t we just copy paste what successful countries are doing ?,"This is a genuine question: why is it so hard to follow the steps of a country that was once poor or in a similar situation, but managed to improve? Why is it so difficult to implement successful policies we’ve already seen work elsewhere? It’s not like we’re reinventing the wheel, we’d just be following a path that’s already proven to work. I’m convinced Tunisia would be in a much better place today if we had done that.

Nowadays, we have access to information about what’s happening all over the world, politics, law, economics, you name it. On top of that, many Tunisians now live abroad and understand how systems work in Europe, for example. So why can’t we replicate what works?

And if the excuse is that “the public won’t agree,” then honestly, scr-ew the public. They wouldn’t agree with modernizing Tunisia yet they will be the first people to hop on a boat to Italy.

A lot of the PL are giving a response such as ""Rights are hierarchical"" to then argue that the ""Right to Life"" sits on top of said pyramid. Then obviously arguing that since RTL is the most important the female persons right to body security can be infringed in order to protect the fetuses RTL.

However, the UN blatantly contradicts that. We see here:

[https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights)

UNICEF sited pretty much the exact same principles.

And here is the declaration of human rights for reference: [https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)

And although this is from UNFPA this is a comprehensive source that I have not found contradicted: [https://www.unfpa.org/resources/human-rights-principles](https://www.unfpa.org/resources/human-rights-principles)

Specifically I am referring to this part:

**Indivisibility:** Human rights are *indivisible*. Whether they relate to civil, cultural, economic, political or social issues, human rights are inherent to the dignity of every human person. ***Consequently, all human rights have equal status, and cannot be positioned in a hierarchical order. Denial of one right invariably impedes enjoyment of other rights***. Thus, the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living cannot be compromised at the expense of other rights, such as the right to health or the right to education.

In other words -- as far the status quo of the world is, rights are NOT in fact hierarchical. The current framework of human rights includes the indivisibility principle and as such any laws made by any government must also follow it. (Now if they do, is a whole other question, but in theory this is the current global goal)

Another source claiming the same: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2018/628296/EPRS\_ATA(2018)628296\_EN.pdf](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2018/628296/EPRS_ATA(2018)628296_EN.pdf)

By itself I would argue this an appeal to authority, however I do think there is a strong reason to agree with definition of rights set forth by the UN. Namely, that in order for something to be a ""right"" it means any and all governments HAVE TO guarantee it to you, you are entitled to each and everyone of them, at all times, no matter what. The moment ""rights"" are hierarchical, they can no longer be called ""rights"" because they can now be infringed on by any government as they see fit with the justification of protecting other ""higher"" rights. You are no longer guaranteed any of them, except for well I guess the very top one.

ETA: I would even argue the RTL cannot be fully ""enjoyed"" without the right to body security. Right to Life it SELF becomes meaningless under a hierarchy. Even if it sits at the top.

For example, if we are to take the PL claim from the previous post and say ""Right to Life"" is the single most important pinnacle of rights - then name any other right and it is no longer a right. Because you are no longer guaranteed it. Freedom of Religion? Nope, Christianity would need to be outlawed pronto. Second Amendment (though only applicable in the US)? Basically gone entirely. Slavery? The government will own persons and labor. And, well the obvious one in this debate: body security. The moment the government can think up any demographic X for whom demographic Y exercises ANY OTHER RIGHT that is NOT the Right to Life, they can make laws to take it away.

I am not even getting into how you may want to order OTHER rights and how that can be used. 

So, they can say a religion causes people to kill themselves therefore outlawed. Guns, Knives, etc are used to kill people so all tools of self defense can quickly be banned. If some certain labor isn't being done, persons are starving and dying of cold so now government can claim their right to life to force other persons to do menial labor on farms or coal mines. And forced organ donation will be across the board, all the time. The government could randomly pick you to donate any non-life threatening organ to anybody because not doing so would cause another to die. Oh, and all rape victims who tried to stop their rapists in any way would also be prosecuted.  All other rights become absolutely meaningless if there is a hierarchy that a government can exploit. Our human dignity - which is the goal of human rights as a whole - is no longer guaranteed.

ETA: Basically, the only thing that becomes guaranteed is you will live - but nothing else. You can be forced to do anything, you can be raped, beaten, property taken away, made to work, degraded, etc. Anything becomes something the government can make laws to justify, as long as they prevent deaths of some persons and you yourself aren't killed in the process.

On top of that, I was NOT able to find a source that is both widely accepted which actually puts rights in a hierarchy. At most I found some articles that place a few rights (not just one, and they usually include right to body security) at the very top and treat those as equal, inalienable and indivisible, but allow things like free speech, assembly and privacy but considered as ""lesser."" But they are mostly philosophical, or highly biased on PL side. I would be looking for a country's constitution or something on the level of the UN for this, that would have to specifically state that their rights are listed in an order of priority and higher rights. I have not, you are welcome to provide.

So then, my questions are:

1. Do the PL just... disagree? Like do you genuinely think rights are hierarchical and the entire system of legal ethics that the world is currently striving for is wrong?
2. Assuming the world does change and suddenly rights can be placed in an order, have you thought about the legal implications of that beyond abortion? What are some ""positive"" ones or ""negative"" ones you have thought of?
3. If your answer to 1 is yes, why are you not fighting against that on the base level? Should there not be protests against the horribleness of the UN or other governments doing human rights all wrong?
4. If your answer to 1 is no, then... you are fine with benefitting from YOUR rights being treated as equal, inalienable, and indivisible, but then want other persons rights to not be that way? After all that is what anti-abortion laws do, they treat the female persons rights as not all three of those. Or the fetus for that matter, as it would give them more rights that are then taken away at birth, and prioritize their rights over others.
5. Using the provided declaration of human rights, or the US constitution if you like, how would order all of those then? Would you group them and make those follow the principles? Or just a straight hierarchy like a list?
6. Lastly if you do accept the principles of human rights that are currently the status quo, how do you justify creating laws with the aim to force a female person to endure a prolonged violation on their right to body security? Considering the right to life then, would not be able to include infringing on another's body security.

For the PC - yes I know the UN also states rights start at birth. I am not ignoring that, its just not the point of the post. But also I don't really care for the technicality. Even if fetuses were given human rights, as long as all the principles of human rights outlines in the supporting sources are followed abortion would have to remain legal. It may mean laws to specifically protect abortion cannot be made either, but the world would basically be in the same state as Canada. Basically no specific laws on the matter at all besides those that overlap with other health related ones.

Another source claiming the same: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2018/628296/EPRS\_ATA(2018)628296\_EN.pdf](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2018/628296/EPRS_ATA(2018)628296_EN.pdf)

By itself I would argue this an appeal to authority, however I do think there is a strong reason to agree with definition of  set forth by the UN. Namely, that in order for something to be a ""right"" it means any and all governments HAVE TO guarantee it to you, you are entitled to each and everyone of them, at all times, no matter what. The moment """" are hierarchical, they can no longer be called """" because they can now be infringed on by any government as they see fit with the justification of protecting other ""higher"" . You are no longer guaranteed any of them, except for well I guess the very top one.

ETA: I would even argue the RTL cannot be fully ""enjoyed"" without the right to body security. Right to Life it SELF becomes meaningless under a hierarchy. Even if it sits at the top.

For example, if we are to take the PL claim from the previous post and say ""Right to Life"" is the single most important pinnacle of  - then name any other right and it is no longer a right. Because you are no longer guaranteed it. Freedom of Religion? Nope, Christianity would need to be outlawed pronto. Second Amendment (though only applicable in the US)? Basically gone entirely. Slavery? The government will own persons and labor. And, well the obvious one in this debate: body security. The moment the government can think up any demographic X for whom demographic Y exercises ANY OTHER RIGHT that is NOT the Right to Life, they can make laws to take it away.

I am not even getting into how you may want to order OTHER  and how that can be used. 

So, they can say a religion causes people to kill themselves therefore outlawed. Guns, Knives, etc are used to kill people so all tools of self defense can quickly be banned. If some certain labor isn't being done, persons are starving and dying of cold so now government can claim their right to life to force other persons to do menial labor on farms or coal mines. And forced organ donation will be across the board, all the time. The government could randomly pick you to donate any non-life threatening organ to anybody because not doing so would cause another to die. Oh, and all rape victims who tried to stop their rapists in any way would also be prosecuted.  All other  become absolutely meaningless if there is a hierarchy that a government can exploit. Our  dignity - which is the goal of   as a whole - is no longer guaranteed.

ETA: Basically, the only thing that becomes guaranteed is you will live - but nothing else. You can be forced to do anything, you can be raped, beaten, property taken away, made to work, degraded, etc. Anything becomes something the government can make laws to justify, as long as they prevent deaths of some persons and you yourself aren't killed in the process.

On top of that, I was NOT able to find a source that is both widely accepted which actually puts  in a hierarchy. At most I found some articles that place a few  (not  one, and they usually include right to body security) at the very top and treat those as , inalienable and indivisible, but allow things like free speech, assembly and privacy but considered as ""lesser."" But they are mostly philosophical, or highly biased on PL side. I would be looking for a country's constitution or something on the level of the UN for this, that would have to specifically state that their  are listed in an order of priority and higher . I have not, you are welcome to provide.

So then, my questions are:

1. Do the PL ... disagree? Like do you genuinely think  are hierarchical and the entire system of legal ethics that the world is currently striving for is wrong?
2. Assuming the world does change and suddenly  can be placed in an order, have you thought about the legal implications of that beyond abortion? What are some ""positive"" ones or ""negative"" ones you have thought of?
3. If your answer to 1 is yes, why are you not fighting against that on the base level? Should there not be protests against the horribleness of the UN or other governments doing   all wrong?
4. If your answer to 1 is no, then... you are fine with benefitting from YOUR  being treated as , inalienable, and indivisible, but then want other persons  to not be that way? After all that is what anti-abortion laws do, they treat the female persons  as not all three of those. Or the fetus for that matter, as it would give them more  that are then taken away at , and prioritize their  over others.
5. Using the provided declaration of  , or the US constitution if you like, how would order all of those then? Would you group them and make those follow the principles? Or  a straight hierarchy like a list?
6. Lastly if you do accept the principles of   that are currently the status quo, how do you justify creating laws with the aim to force a female person to endure a prolonged violation on their right to body security? Considering the right to life then, would not be able to include infringing on another's body security.

For the PC - yes I know the UN also states  start at . I am not ignoring that, its  not the point of the post. But also I 't really care for the technicality. Even if fetuses were given  , as long as all the principles of   outlines in the supporting sources are followed abortion would have to remain legal. It may mean laws to specifically protect abortion cannot be made either, but the world would basically be in the same state as Canada. Basically no specific laws on the matter at all besides those that overlap with other health related ones.

Birth control is not abortion. And abortion is not murder.

This kind of language is intentionally inflammatory and factually incorrect.
Equating emergency contraception or IUDs with “life-ending drugs” is a scare tactic rooted in ideology not science.

Contraceptives prevent pregnancy.
Abortion ends a pregnancy.
Neither of these things “kill children.” And conflating the two puts real people in real danger by threatening access to critical healthcare.

Also, let’s address the slippery slope here:
If you start calling birth control “murder,” then guess what happens next?

- People lose access to contraceptives.

- People can’t plan families.

- People are forced into pregnancy.

- People suffer and die from preventable health complications.


This isn’t about protecting life. It’s about controlling it.

Nobody is forcing you to use birth control.

Birth control is not abortion. And abortion is not murder.

This kind of language is intentionally inflammatory and factually incorrect.
Equating emergency contraception or IUDs with “life-ending drugs” is a scare tactic rooted in ideology not science.

Contraceptives prevent pregnancy.
Abortion ends a pregnancy.
Neither of these things “kill children.” And conflating the two puts real people in real danger by threatening access to critical healthcare.

Also, let’s address the slippery slope here:
If you start calling birth control “murder,” then guess what happens next?

- People lose access to contraceptives.

- People can’t plan families.

- People are forced into pregnancy.

- People suffer and die from preventable health complications.


This isn’t about protecting life. It’s about controlling it.

Yes, she lied to my face for eight years. We originally ended our friendship because she said some of the most hurtful, disgusting things you can say to a best friend. This isn’t about political differences, it’s about how badly she treated me. She came back into my life after something traumatic happened to me, apologized, claimed she had changed, and presented herself as more kind, left-leaning, and remorseful. I believed her because I thought we had both grown and healed. I was wrong.

A few months ago, I started noticing red flags again. It only took me a few minutes of searching publicly available info to realize she had likely been lying all along. Talking to people who knew us confirmed it. It wasn’t subtle, others saw it clearly. She misled me deliberately just to be friends again while still acting the same behind my back. If you have to lie and fake change to be close to someone, you’re not a better person, you’re manipulative. So no, I’m not upset over politics. I’m upset that someone who hurt me deeply pretended to be different just to get back in my life and lied the whole time.

Just to clarify, I've given her a lot of time and space to develop her own thoughts. I've also been incredibly patient as she had recently been through A LOT of harships lately —had family members with cancer, death of a parent, abusive ex, loss of job, etc. 

I also need to need to state that she grew up in a tiny, conservative town with a conservative religious family. 

However, she has been pretty insistent during our almost decade long friendship she's not political at all. She claims to not even know the symbols, colors, etc of each party. She hates discussing politics and prefers to keep it surface level because she's not educated enough. She also says it's because of her mental health.

With that said, I have begun to notice a lot of concerning signs that might point to her, not being as neutral as she claims. 

For example, she actually checked out JD Vance's book ""Hillbilly Eglegy"", which she claims that she did not know he wrote it and was immediately triggered when I brought it up and pointed out that she is Christian and wants a two parent household with her being a stay at home, and her husband working. I've been very clear that I don't care that she wants that as long as it's not something imposed on to everyone but I did think it was odd that she stated it when I was talking about that book (considering it had nothing to do with my personal discussion of it). 

In the message, she also stated that we have different political opinions that she just doesn't bring up because she respects my views, which to me was concerning considering she's never stated as such previously. I know she has her personal views on abortion, but claimed she didn't think that they should be regulated by the government and that it's just up to the person. She also doesn't think religion should be in government at all. 

However, all of her ""friends"" she doesn't seem to like but still hangs out with are conservative. I didn't like this but these people are her childhood friends and she lives in a tiny, tiny town, so I was not as harsh about that. She also claims to stand up for minorities when people are being racist, xenophobic, etc. I wouldn't know any of this to be true because we are long distance best friends so I have no clue what she's doing or saying with them. 

The part that bothers me is that she's registered to vote at a minimum. I looked it up and it's concerning because she's very admitted she's not political and has never voted because she's not educated enough. I'd dismiss this as being before me but we've been best friends since we were 19... so she's been an adult for every Trump election except for the first one. And I should clarify, she was a trump supporter during his first term when she was in college and has since said she isn't political or educated enough to make an opinion. She also only brings up boundaries when she's upset with our political or religious conversation. And I'm never calling her out herself. I'm talking about child brides, sexual assault, bans on same sex marriage, etc.  

The reason I looked her voting record up to begin with was because her actions were not lining up with her ""views"". She very supportive of the church, has almost all conservative friends, is reading political adjacent books, she's making weird statements about her religion and politics without me discussing it (she's acting like she's defending herself?). She has also said she pretends to agree (or stays nuetral) with people to keep them calm and has even in an argument told me she leaves me venting about politics on the phone while she does something else and how I never notice she's left and come back, but then said she just meant she was distracted... 

I also looked at her following on her accounts and oh boy is it only conservative white southerners and extremely problematic celebrities and influencers. Like rape allegations and straight up racism. 

Between all of this I'm convinced she's been lying to me. She said she didn't even know the colors of the parties... looking back there's no way she didn't know. She has a college education, she's not stupid. 

I'm feeling very betrayed. She seemed like she made so much progress but now I think she was faking it to keep our friendship which I'm convinced she only wanted to keep, because she's made it clear her other friends are extremely surface-level and not very empathetic, or understanding. So I guess she's got to keep her up, leftist friend around as a therapist or something —which she has called me. 

We had one major fight about gays going to help which he didn't talk to for 2 months and then she had a change of opinion.. which I feel like was a lie now..

She has listening to me cry and struggle with politics and knowing all this has me feeling sick to my stomach. I hate hypocrites and liars and she knows this. I take my morals very seriously and was trying to be patient and understanding with her.  

Am I overreacting? I think I know the answer but it's hurts to lose a decade long friendship. I hate that I was naive and dumb to take her word as fact. It hurts worse because I've moved a lot and have only her as a friend. I've turned into an agoraphobe with the state of the world and haven't pushed myself to make friends. Doesn't help being a mom to a toddler or having covid isolate me during the moves. Regardless any opnions help as I have no one to turn to talk about this.

","i think `` non-political '' friend is to me ... update : yes , she to my face for eight years . we originally ended our friendship because she said some of the most , things you can say to a friend . this isn ’ t about political differences , it ’ s about how she treated me . she came back into my life after something happened to me , apologized , claimed she had changed , and presented herself as more kind , , and . i believed her because i thought we had both grown and healed . i was . a few months ago , i started noticing red flags again . it only took me a few minutes of searching publicly info to realize she had likely been all along . talking to people who knew us confirmed it . it wasn ’ t subtle , others saw it . she misled me deliberately  to be friends again while still acting the same behind my back . if you have to and change to be close to someone , you ’ re not a person , you ’ re . so no , i ’ m not over politics . i ’ m that someone who me deeply pretended to be different  to get back in my life and the whole time . -- -- -- -  to clarify , i 've given her a lot of time and space to develop her own thoughts . i 've also been as she had recently been through a lot of harships lately —had family members with , of a parent , ex , of job , etc . i also need to need to state that she grew up in a tiny , town with a religious family . however , she has been insistent during our almost decade long friendship she 's not political at all . she claims to not even know the symbols , colors , etc of each party . she discussing politics and to keep it surface level because she 's not . she also says it 's because of her mental health . with that said , i have begun to notice a lot of concerning signs that might point to her , not being as neutral as she claims . for example , she actually checked out jd vance 's book `` hillbilly eglegy '' , which she claims that she did not know he wrote it and was immediately triggered when i brought it up and pointed out that she is christian and wants a two parent household with her being a stay at home , and her husband working . i 've been very that i do n't care that she wants that as long as it 's not something imposed on to everyone but i did think it was that she stated it when i was talking about that book ( considering it had nothing to do with my personal discussion of it ) . in the message , she also stated that we have different political opinions that she  does n't bring up because she respects my views , which to me was concerning considering she 's never stated as such previously . i know she has her personal views on abortion , but claimed she did n't think that they should be regulated by the government and that it 's  up to the person . she also does n't think religion should be in government at all . however , all of her `` friends '' she does n't seem to but still out with are . i did n't this but these people are her childhood friends and she lives in a tiny , tiny town , so i was not as about that . she also claims to stand up for minorities when people are being , xenophobic , etc . i would n't know any of this to be true because we are long distance friends so i have no clue what she 's doing or saying with them . the part that me is that she 's registered to vote at a minimum . i looked it up and it 's concerning because she 's very admitted she 's not political and has never voted because she 's not . i 'd dismiss this as being before me but we 've been friends since we were 19 ... so she 's been an adult for every election except for the first one . and i should clarify , she was a during his first term when she was in college and has since said she is n't political or to make an opinion . she also only brings up boundaries when she 's with our political or religious conversation . and i 'm never calling her out herself . i 'm talking about child brides , sexual , bans on same sex marriage , etc . the reason i looked her voting record up to begin with was because her actions were not lining up with her `` views '' . she very of the church , has almost all friends , is reading political adjacent books , she 's making statements about her religion and politics without me discussing it ( she 's acting she 's defending herself ? ) . she has also said she pretends to agree ( or stays nuetral ) with people to keep them and has even in an argument told me she leaves me venting about politics on the phone while she does something else and how i never notice she 's  and come back , but then said she  meant she was distracted ... i also looked at her following on her accounts and oh boy is it only white southerners and extremely celebrities and influencers . and straight up . between all of this i 'm convinced she 's been to me . she said she did n't even know the colors of the parties ... looking back there 's no way she did n't know . she has a college education , she 's not . i 'm feeling very betrayed . she seemed she made so much but now i think she was faking it to keep our friendship which i 'm convinced she only wanted to keep , because she 's made it her other friends are extremely surface-level and not very empathetic , or understanding . so i guess she 's got to keep her up , leftist friend around as a therapist or something —which she has called me . we had one major fight about gays going to help which he did n't talk to for 2 months and then she had a change of opinion .. which i feel was a now .. she has listening to me and with politics and knowing all this has me feeling to my stomach . i and and she knows this . i take my morals very seriously and was trying to be and understanding with her . am i overreacting ? i think i know the answer but it 's to a decade long friendship . i that i was and to take her word as fact . it because i 've moved a lot and have only her as a friend . i 've turned into an agoraphobe with the state of the world and have n't pushed myself to make friends . does n't help being a mom to a toddler or having covid me during the moves . regardless any opnions help as i have no one to turn to talk about this ."

I'll present the arguments I've heard against abortions here and refute them in the ways I would argue.

""Every human being should have the right to life."" A human fetus really hasn't started living a human life yet. It's never laughed or cried or even seen the light of day. And if the mother wants to abort it, then it hasn't formed any meaningful social connections either. If I were to ask you what day you would consider to be the first day of your life, you'd say the day you were born, not the day you were conceived. If you're not even living a human life yet then you're not really a human being yet.

""Wait, but you just called it a human fetus back there! You're admitting it's a human being and therefore  it has the right to life!"" No, a human fetus isn't a human in the same way that human hair or a human hand isn't a human. Just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it a human being.

""A fetus is a baby, and you wouldn't kill a baby."" Calling a fetus a baby just goes against common sense.  No one in their right mind would place smashing a petri dish with a human IVF embryo in it and killing a baby on the same moral tier. It just goes against intuition. If you google image search ""baby,"" you would never find a picture of a fetus no matter how long you scrolled for.

""My religion says life begins at conception."" And I believe that it doesn't. We're both allowed to have our own beliefs, but beliefs don't form rational arguments. Logic and reason do.

""Abortion scars women for life."" Not getting an abortion when you don't want to give birth is even more scarring. No one gets an abortion because they like doing it, it's just the lesser of two evils.

""Some women die during abortions."" The WHO says ""Deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000 *(5).* On the other hand, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions."" I imagine unsafe abortions occur in places where abortion is illegal, but that's just my supposition. Either way, death by abortion doesn't seem like a huge issue.

I could list other counter-arguments I can refute, but I'll stop there. At the end of the day, women (and everyone for that matter) should be able to control the inner workings of their bodies as much as they can. That much seems like a common-sense human right to me. And lastly, what kind of a life could you expect to have if your own mother didn't want to have you? Abortions ensure that only babies that would be cared for and that are wanted would come into being. So being pro-choice isn't just being pro-choice, it's also being pro-love.

  
Edit: Because a lot of people are asking, my preferred cutoff for abortions is birth. After that, no killing; before that, it's the woman's choice. 

Edit 2: For the record, I truly wish I didn’t hold the views I’m illustrating here. I would love to think that every fetus is a precious thing and life is inherently good and valuable in every instance. But from my life experiences and grasp of logic, it’s very hard for me not to gravitate towards this stance.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/pEXnZtjIZp): **May 15, 2025**

My life will never be the same after this. We’ve been married for two weeks. My 27 year old husband has been sleeping with my little sister behind my back. She’s 17, legal age of consent, but she’s still a baby. We just found out she’s one month pregnant, but she refused to say who the father is. 

Yesterday my parents asked me to come over. Apparently, they installed a monitoring app on her phone and that’s how they found out he’s the father. My sister is saying she is sorry over and over again. 

My husband also apologized, saying he made a mistake and wants us to go to counseling and stay married. I didn’t say much. I told him I’m filing for divorce. I’m not changing my mind.

I know for sure I’ll never speak to him again after everything’s over. As for my sister, I don’t know. I honestly don’t know.

*An update has been posted.*

**Relevant / Top Comments** 

**What are OOP and her parents' plans to do with her little sister?**

> **OOP:** I don’t know yet. On one hand she knew she was doing something wrong, but on the other she’s just a kid. I don’t know how to feel or what to do.

**Commenter 1:** I'm so sorry OP.

How long has he known your sister?

**Commenter 3:** Check whether you can file for annulment rather than divorce - he married you under false pretences while fathering a child with another woman. The dates will support the annulment.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/jwEzXTHLzN): **May 16, 2025 (next day)**

Update: My husband was arrested this morning.

Thank you to everyone who read my first post and offered support. It feels like I’m living a nightmare. A lot more has happened, so I wanted to post an update.

The day I posted, they took my sister to the police. She admitted that the “relationship” with my husband began when she was 15. She also said things became physical when she was 16. They had exchanged inappropriate messages and images, and the content on her phone matched everything she told them. My soon to be ex knew she was pregnant. He was arrested at his job earlier today. Last night was the first time in a year that I went to bed and he wasn’t there. It felt surreal.

My dad, who is very religious, insists my sister keep the baby. My mom believes she should have the choice to end the pregnancy.

I’ve already contacted a lawyer for the annulment and emphasized that I want no more contact with him. There’s nothing left to salvage.

Even though my sister has apologized several times, she still believes she’s in love with him. My family is planning to start family counseling soon. It will be focused on figuring out how to move forward and what kind of relationship, if any, I want to have with my sister. There are no clear answers right now.

The support I’ve received from people here has helped me feel less alone. Thank you.

My life will never be the same after this. We’ve been married for two weeks. My 27 year old husband has been sleeping with my little sister behind my back. She’s 17, legal age of consent, but she’s still a baby. We just found out she’s one month pregnant, but she refused to say who the father is. 

Yesterday my parents asked me to come over. Apparently, they installed a monitoring app on her phone and that’s how they found out he’s the father. My sister is saying she is sorry over and over again. 

My husband also apologized, saying he made a mistake and wants us to go to counseling and stay married. I didn’t say much. I told him I’m filing for divorce. I’m not changing my mind.

I know for sure I’ll never speak to him again after everything’s over. As for my sister, I don’t know. I honestly don’t know.

This is so messy. My ex husband 29m, and I 28f, originally agreed not to have any children. We live in Texas and this world just isn’t a place I wanted to bring a child into. I also never wanted to be a mother.

My IUD failed and I got pregnant. I was devastated because I wouldn’t be able to get an abortion since we live in Texas. I wanted to travel out of state to get an abortion, and I wanted him to get a vasectomy since I didn’t want to risk this happening again. He refused both. He said he wouldn’t take me out of state to get an abortion, and he made me very scared of criminal charges. He also refused a vasectomy to prevent more children, since he ‘didn’t want to mutilate himself’.

Long story short, I filed for divorce a month after the baby was born. It took a little over two months for the divorce to be finalized, which was a month ago. Baby is now four months old, and the maternity leave that I was lucky enough to have is up. Ex- Husband has moved into his own apartment. I live alone in my home that I owned prior to marriage, that I inherited from my grandparents.

***\[Editor's note:*** *as to the timeline of the divorce. I looked through several law websites in Texas. General consensus seems to be that most uncontested divorces in Texas take an average of 3-4 months, but that some can be faster, especially since the waiting period is only 61 days. OOP's 'over 2 months' timeline is not unfeasible. Custody questions are answered in her comments\]*

Ex husband has been visiting the baby here and there on weekends, but hasn’t had the baby overnight ever. I’ve suggested it but he refused.

To be honest, I don’t really like being a mother. The baby and I just haven’t bonded much. I’ve heard that sometimes it takes a while. I’ve been overwhelmed and I needed a break. I tried calling him and talking to him about agreeing to a custody situation. He blew me off and said he’ll let me know when he finds a weekend that works for him.

I was really pissed. I had this baby because of him largely, or I would’ve gotten an abortion. I love my baby but I don’t want to be a full time mom, I want 50/50. I work from home as a software developer. I’m lucky enough to be able to watch the baby while I work so I don’t have to pay for daycare. But I need time to be productive with my work. So I figure one week I can be unproductive while watching my child, and the next week I can work extra hard to makeup for it. My job is flexible so it’ll work for me.

My ex was dodging my calls, so I took our son and a diaper bag and showed up at my ex’s work. He works as a car salesman. He was shocked to see me, and even more shocked when I handed him the baby. I told him, ‘we’re doing 50/50 custody. You have the baby this week. You can drop him off at my house next Monday.’

He freaked out, said who will watch the baby while he works. I suggested he pay for daycare if he needs it. He said he can’t afford daycare. We argued and I told him to figure it out. If I have to figure out how to be a mom he has to figure out how to be a dad.

His parents are calling me every name under the damn sun, meanwhile they don’t want to babysit for him.

AITAH?

Edit: for all of you suggesting adoption, I tried that while I was pregnant. Ex refused. I couldn’t give the baby up for adoption without his permission. Also, I’ve contacted a lawyer about getting custody formalized but I haven’t heard back.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter (downvoted): ESH You all sound have never become parents. If you wanted an abortion, you could have driven yourself. You need a lawyer, not Reddit. 

>**OOP:** You’re right. I shouldn’t have become a parent. But I was afraid of going to jail, so I chose not to go out of state.

Commenter (highly upvoted and awarded): Give the poor kid up for adoption. Christ

>**OOP:** I suggested that while I was pregnant. He said he would never agree to that. I can’t do it without his consent.

Commenter: Then force custody through the courts so you can resent the baby less long term.

>**OOP:** I don’t resent the baby at all. I resent him. I still want to be a mother to my child at this point, and I’m waiting for the bond to happen. I just don’t want to be a single parent. I want him to step up the way I’m stepping up.

Commenter (part of a getting tubes tied conversation): Dr. Michael Balat, Plaza Ob-Gyn, downtown Houston. Did mine. No prior kids. No trying to talk me out of it. Asked if I wanted it, I said yes, he said he’d do it.

>**OOP:** Thank you!! Houston is a somewhat reasonable drive for me so that may be where I go.

Commenter: This is fake. No family court in the world is going to let a divorce go through without a custody arrangement for the children.

**Ashamed-Director-428:** So. He doesn't want the baby, but wouldn't allow you to abort and threatened you legal action if you did abort.

He doesn't want to look after the baby, but refuses to allow you adopt the child out.

Yeah. You need to speak with a lawyer, soon. Either he steps up and actually looks after his child a minimum of half of the time, or he needs to sign the adoption papers.

Does anyone really think that it's in the babies best interests to grow up with two parents who fight to make the other take him on the regular?

>**Unhappy-Beat-4510:** No. I would find an attorney and get him to the abandoned status of the baby and then you could pursue adoption. That baby shouldn't grow up with both parents nor wanting him.

Less than a day after my last post I attempted suicide. I took every hidden pain pill I had leftover from surgeries, etc, and just went to sleep. If it weren’t for my cousin coming to check on how I was doing without the baby I wouldn’t be here today.

I spent 16 days in inpatient psych, and was diagnosed with ppd and post partum psychosis.

After my Reddit post I was flooded with comments and dm’s telling me what a monster I am for having a child that I didn’t originally want. People said that my child would be better off without me, that my ex husband and I are just going to ruin our child’s life. Adoption was something pushed, because to most commenters there was no way I could ever manage to be a good mother. I had considered adoption at one point, but the time for that had passed. Many people latched onto that as a sign that I shouldn’t have my child.

The worst part was the dms. A lot of people outright told me to just kill myself so my child doesn’t have to deal with me anymore. Many men said women are just whores who don’t want to deal with the consequences of sex. Many tried to pressure me into giving them my child. Couples with infertility issues telling me that it’s not fair that I had a child I didn’t want while they’re struggling, and that my child would be better off with them.

There was even one where she started off friendly and helpful, and we chatted for hours. Just to turn and call me every name in the book when I said I’m not giving her my child.

It was all too much. I already felt terrible for just needing a break and some time to myself. It had been a long time since I’ve so much as showered alone.

In inpatient I met a very kind nurse who told me she struggled with the same things after having her child, and it took a long time to bond. But eventually everything clicked into place. I’ll never forget her.

Since getting out my ex and his family have been quiet and somewhat apologetic. He has agreed to split custody. My ex asked me to pay a small amount towards daycare for his custody time, with his parents also chipping in, and I agreed.

He’s had the baby since I’ve been out as I’ve been adjusting to some med changes that have been making me feel like I’m in the twilight zone. But he drops the baby off for a few hours at a time, and my cousin is mostly here to help me.

Things have been okay, and they’re getting better. I’ve been remorseful, and the thought of my child growing up without a mother potentially made me sad. I’m in therapy, and I’m trying to do whatever I can to be a better mother. I just needed help.

So yeah. My advice to anyone out there who is struggling, go to counseling. Find some kind of group therapy to attend. Reach out to your family. Get psychiatric help if you need it. There’s a lot of bad people out there, and the internet is not your friend.

I’m glad I’m still here. Other women haven’t been as lucky, and there have even some that have taken their babies with them. If it were up to some people who dm’d me I’d be dead right now.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kar9q3/aitah_for_dropping_our_baby_off_on_my_ex_husband/)**: April 29, 2025**

This is so messy. My ex husband 29m, and I 28f, originally agreed not to have any children. We live in Texas and this world just isn’t a place I wanted to bring a child into. I also never wanted to be a mother.

My IUD failed and I got pregnant. I was devastated because I wouldn’t be able to get an abortion since we live in Texas. I wanted to travel out of state to get an abortion, and I wanted him to get a vasectomy since I didn’t want to risk this happening again. He refused both. He said he wouldn’t take me out of state to get an abortion, and he made me very scared of criminal charges. He also refused a vasectomy to prevent more children, since he ‘didn’t want to mutilate himself’.

Long story short, I filed for divorce a month after the baby was born. It took a little over two months for the divorce to be finalized, which was a month ago. Baby is now four months old, and the maternity leave that I was lucky enough to have is up. Ex- Husband has moved into his own apartment. I live alone in my home that I owned prior to marriage, that I inherited from my grandparents.

***\[Editor's note:*** *as to the timeline of the divorce. I looked through several law websites in Texas. General consensus seems to be that most uncontested divorces in Texas take an average of 3-4 months, but that some can be faster, especially since the waiting period is only 61 days. OOP's 'over 2 months' timeline is not unfeasible. Custody questions are answered in her comments\]*

Ex husband has been visiting the baby here and there on weekends, but hasn’t had the baby overnight ever. I’ve suggested it but he refused.

To be honest, I don’t really like being a mother. The baby and I just haven’t bonded much. I’ve heard that sometimes it takes a while. I’ve been overwhelmed and I needed a break. I tried calling him and talking to him about agreeing to a custody situation. He blew me off and said he’ll let me know when he finds a weekend that works for him.

I was really pissed. I had this baby because of him largely, or I would’ve gotten an abortion. I love my baby but I don’t want to be a full time mom, I want 50/50. I work from home as a software developer. I’m lucky enough to be able to watch the baby while I work so I don’t have to pay for daycare. But I need time to be productive with my work. So I figure one week I can be unproductive while watching my child, and the next week I can work extra hard to makeup for it. My job is flexible so it’ll work for me.

My ex was dodging my calls, so I took our son and a diaper bag and showed up at my ex’s work. He works as a car salesman. He was shocked to see me, and even more shocked when I handed him the baby. I told him, ‘we’re doing 50/50 custody. You have the baby this week. You can drop him off at my house next Monday.’

He freaked out, said who will watch the baby while he works. I suggested he pay for daycare if he needs it. He said he can’t afford daycare. We argued and I told him to figure it out. If I have to figure out how to be a mom he has to figure out how to be a dad.

His parents are calling me every name under the damn sun, meanwhile they don’t want to babysit for him.

AITAH?

Edit: for all of you suggesting adoption, I tried that while I was pregnant. Ex refused. I couldn’t give the baby up for adoption without his permission. Also, I’ve contacted a lawyer about getting custody formalized but I haven’t heard back.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter (downvoted): ESH You all sound have never become parents. If you wanted an abortion, you could have driven yourself. You need a lawyer, not Reddit. 

>**OOP:** You’re right. I shouldn’t have become a parent. But I was afraid of going to jail, so I chose not to go out of state.

Commenter (highly upvoted and awarded): Give the poor kid up for adoption. Christ

>**OOP:** I suggested that while I was pregnant. He said he would never agree to that. I can’t do it without his consent.

Commenter: Then force custody through the courts so you can resent the baby less long term.

>**OOP:** I don’t resent the baby at all. I resent him. I still want to be a mother to my child at this point, and I’m waiting for the bond to happen. I just don’t want to be a single parent. I want him to step up the way I’m stepping up.

Commenter (part of a getting tubes tied conversation): Dr. Michael Balat, Plaza Ob-Gyn, downtown Houston. Did mine. No prior kids. No trying to talk me out of it. Asked if I wanted it, I said yes, he said he’d do it.

>**OOP:** Thank you!! Houston is a somewhat reasonable drive for me so that may be where I go.

Commenter: This is fake. No family court in the world is going to let a divorce go through without a custody arrangement for the children.

>**OOP:** The baby was a month old when I filed for divorce. We agreed for me to have full custody for the time being, because the baby was a newborn and I was on maternity leave. We agreed to revisit it in the next few months. I have since contacted an attorney to do it.

This is so messy. My ex husband 29m, and I 28f, originally agreed not to have any children. We live in Texas and this world  isn’t a place I wanted to bring a child into. I also never wanted to be a mother.

My IUD failed and I got pregnant. I was devastated because I wouldn’t be able to get an abortion since we live in Texas. I wanted to travel out of state to get an abortion, and I wanted him to get a vasectomy since I didn’t want to risk this happening again. He refused both.

He also refused a vasectomy to prevent more children, since he ‘didn’t want to mutilate himself’.

Long story short, I filed for divorce a month after the baby was born. It took a little over two months for the divorce to be finalized, which was a month ago. Baby is now four months old, and the maternity leave that I was lucky enough to have is up. Ex- Husband has moved into his own apartment. I live alone in my home that I owned prior to marriage, that I inherited from my grandparents.

I told him, ‘we’re doing 50/50 custody. You have the baby this . You can drop him off at my house next Monday.’

He freaked out, said who will watch the baby while he works. I suggested he pay for daycare if he  it. He said he can’t afford daycare. We argued and I told him to figure it out. If I have to figure out how to be a mom he has to figure out how to be a dad.

His parents are calling me every name under the damn sun, meanwhile they ’t want to babysit for him.

AITAH?

Edit: for all of you suggesting adoption, I tried that while I was pregnant. Ex refused. I couldn’t give the baby up for adoption without his permission. Also, I’ve contacted a lawyer about getting custody formalized but I haven’t heard back.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter (downvoted): ESH You all sound have never become parents. If you wanted an abortion, you could have driven yourself. You need a lawyer, not Reddit. 

>**OOP:** You’re right. I shouldn’t have become a parent. But I was afraid of going to jail, so I chose not to go out of state.

Commenter (highly upvoted and awarded): Give the poor kid up for adoption. Christ

>**OOP:** I suggested that while I was pregnant. He said he would never agree to that. I can’t do it without his consent.

Commenter: Then force custody through the courts so you can resent the baby less long term.

>**OOP:** I ’t resent the baby at all. I resent him. I still want to be a mother to my child at this point, and I’m waiting for the bond to happen. I  ’t want to be a single parent. I want him to step up the way I’m stepping up.

Commenter (part of a getting tubes tied conversation): Dr. Michael Balat, Plaza Ob-Gyn, downtown Houston. Did mine. No prior kids. No trying to talk me out of it. Asked if I wanted it, I said yes, he said he’d do it.

>**OOP:** Thank you!! Houston is a somewhat reasonable drive for me so that may be where I go.

Commenter: This is fake. No family court in the world is going to let a divorce go through without a custody arrangement for the children.

>**OOP:** The baby was a month old when I filed for divorce. We agreed for me to have full custody for the time being, because the baby was a newborn and I was on maternity leave. We agreed to revisit it in the next few months. I have since contacted an attorney to do it.

***Top Comment:***

**Ashamed-Director-428:** So. He doesn't want the baby, but wouldn't allow you to abort and threatened you legal action if you did abort.

He doesn't want to look after the baby, but refuses to allow you adopt the child out.

Yeah. You need to speak with a lawyer, soon. Either he steps up and actually looks after his child a minimum of half of the time, or he  to sign the adoption papers.

Does anyone really think that it's in the babies best interests to grow up with two parents who fight to make the other take him on the regular?

>**Unhappy-Beat-4510:** No. I would find an attorney and get him to the abandoned status of the baby and then you could pursue adoption. That baby shouldn't grow up with both parents nor wanting him.

***There is no consensus bot on AITAH. Top comment was NTA but comments were mixed.***

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kuddh1/update_aitah_for_dropping_my_baby_off_with_my_ex/)**: May 24, 2025 (almost 1 month later)**

Less than a day after my last post I attempted suicide. I took every hidden pain pill I had leftover from surgeries, etc, and  went to sleep. If it weren’t for my cousin coming to check on how I was doing without the baby I wouldn’t be here today.

I spent 16 days in inpatient psych, and was diagnosed with ppd and post partum psychosis.

After my Reddit post I was flooded with comments and dm’s telling me what a monster I am for having a child that I didn’t originally want. People said that my child would be better off without me, that my ex husband and I are  going to ruin our child’s life. Adoption was something pushed, because to most commenters there was no way I could ever manage to be a good mother. I had considered adoption at one point, but the time for that had passed. Many people latched onto that as a sign that I shouldn’t have my child.

The worst part was the dms. A lot of people outright told me to  kill myself so my child doesn’t have to deal with me anymore. Many men said  are  whores who ’t want to deal with the consequences of sex. Many tried to pressure me into giving them my child. Couples with infertility issues telling me that it’s not fair that I had a child I didn’t want while they’re struggling, and that my child would be better off with them.

There was even one where she started off friendly and helpful, and we chatted for hours.  to turn and call me every name in the book when I said I’m not giving her my child.

It was all too much. I already felt terrible for  needing a break and some time to myself. It had been a long time since I’ve so much as showered alone.

In inpatient I met a very kind nurse who told me she struggled with the same things after having her child, and it took a long time to bond. But eventually everything clicked into place. I’ll never forget her.

Since getting out my ex and his family have been quiet and somewhat apologetic. He has agreed to split custody. My ex asked me to pay a small amount towards daycare for his custody time, with his parents also chipping in, and I agreed.

He’s had the baby since I’ve been out as I’ve been adjusting to some med changes that have been making me feel like I’m in the twilight zone. But he drops the baby off for a few hours at a time, and my cousin is mostly here to help me.

Things have been okay, and they’re getting better. I’ve been remorseful, and the thought of my child growing up without a mother potentially made me sad. I’m in therapy, and I’m trying to do whatever I can to be a better mother. I  needed help.

So yeah. My advice to anyone out there who is struggling, go to counseling. Find some kind of group therapy to attend. Reach out to your family. Get psychiatric help if you need it. There’s a lot of bad people out there, and the internet is not your friend.

I’m glad I’m still here. Other  haven’t been as lucky, and there have even some that have taken their babies with them. If it were up to some people who dm’d me I’d be dead right now.

Transcript:

>!You are a shitty person. Deal with the consequences of YOUR shitty choice and woman up and be there for your child. Millions of other mothers raised kids single. Stop being so fucking greedy and self centered and deal with the life you created. Good lord, I couldn't imagine having a child and not giving a fuck about them. You are a terrible person. You should abort your life if you even consider giving that kid up to a life of hell that is adoption. !<

Abortion should be legal until fetal viability.

All drug use should not be criminal for the user. Tobacco, alcohol, weed, hallucinogenics, MDMA, should be legal for adults, taxed and regulated.

Right to bear arms should be constitutionally enshrined.

Elective euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legal.

All speech that is not a call to commit crimes, a threat of violence, the distribution of abuse material or confidential data without the owner's consent, an act of perjury or fraud should be legal, including screaming fire where none exists, hate speech, flying racist flags or denying the Holocaust. Speech regulation should be up to civil society.

Trans medicine for gender-dysphoric minors should be addressed like is any other treatment for minors, i.e. with the government out of it (beyond evaluating and regulating medicine used for treating gender dysphoria based on objective safety metrics and reasonable compromises, as is the case with every other medical item). Importing medicine internationally should be legal, cheaper and more common.

Copyright law should be removed from criminal law. IP suits should be settled in civil courts and copyright ownership should be limited to 50 years. Copying digital media for personal use should be legal regardless of digital protection schemes.

Zoning and occupational licensing should be significantly curtailed. All taxes on land, capital gains, income and corporate taxes shall be abolished, preferably in an international fashion. Tax revenue should be replaced with a land value tax, carbon tax and other pigouvian taxes that create incentive structures supporting sustainable economic growth and individual freedoms.

Nuclear reactor life should be prolonged as much as possible, running existing plants into the ground to recoup maximum value out of existing investments, but with the awareness that most likely, the power grid will not find its long-term future in nuclear technology, but in renewables, storage, and NG/LNG for peaks in the interim. EVs are a Very Good Thing, they should be adopted more; chargers should be available on every public road.

“A 30-year-old mother and nurse was declared brain dead months ago, but she is still being kept alive because she’s pregnant. Now, her family has questions about Georgia’s heartbeat law and why they didn’t have a say in her care.

Adriana Smith, a registered nurse at Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital, was about 9 weeks pregnant when she started having bad headaches in February. The 30-year-old went to Northside Hospital for help but was released after being given medication, according to her mother, April Newkirk

“They gave her some medication, but they didn’t do any tests, didn’t do any CT scans. If they did, they would have caught it,” Newkirk said.

The next morning, Smith’s boyfriend noticed something was terribly wrong.

“She was gasping for air in her sleep, gargling. More than likely, it was blood,” Newkirk said.

Smith ended up being taken to the hospital where she worked. A CT scan revealed multiple blood clots in her brain. Unfortunately, there was nothing doctors could do, and Smith was declared brain dead.

…Now at 21 weeks gestation, the baby’s health is uncertain. Smith was moved to Emory Midtown on Tuesday, which doctors told the family is better equipped for obstetric care. The plan is to keep Smith alive until doctors believe the baby can survive outside the womb, likely at 32 weeks.

…More than 90 days later, Smith’s family, including her young son, is still by her side as she remains on life support, but they say they weren’t given any say in her case because of Georgia’s heartbeat law. The law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around 6 weeks into pregnancy.”


“In Smith’s case, the state’s heartbeat law created a legal gray area. There are limited exceptions, including for rape, incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Because Smith is brain dead and no longer considered at risk herself, her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability.

The family says doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.

“I think every woman should have the right to make their own decision, and if not, then their partner or their parents,” Newkirk said. “I’m not saying we would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy, but what I’m saying is we should have had a choice.”

Newkirk says she wants people to understand the human toll of Georgia’s law and the emotional weight of being stripped of medical decision-making during a crisis.”

If not, how can we adjust the law to reflect our values? A snippet from Fox News for context:

“A 30-year-old mother and nurse was declared brain dead months ago, but she is still being kept alive because she’s pregnant. Now, her family has questions about Georgia’s heartbeat law and why they didn’t have a say in her care.

Adriana Smith, a registered nurse at Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital, was about 9 weeks pregnant when she started having bad headaches in February. The 30-year-old went to Northside Hospital for help but was released after being given medication, according to her mother, April Newkirk

“They gave her some medication, but they didn’t do any tests, didn’t do any CT scans. If they did, they would have caught it,” Newkirk said.

The next morning, Smith’s boyfriend noticed something was terribly wrong.

“She was gasping for air in her sleep, gargling. More than likely, it was blood,” Newkirk said.

Smith ended up being taken to the hospital where she worked. A CT scan revealed multiple blood clots in her brain. Unfortunately, there was nothing doctors could do, and Smith was declared brain dead.

…Now at 21 weeks gestation, the baby’s health is uncertain. Smith was moved to Emory Midtown on Tuesday, which doctors told the family is better equipped for obstetric care. The plan is to keep Smith alive until doctors believe the baby can survive outside the womb, likely at 32 weeks.

…More than 90 days later, Smith’s family, including her young son, is still by her side as she remains on life support, but they say they weren’t given any say in her case because of Georgia’s heartbeat law. The law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around 6 weeks into pregnancy.”


“In Smith’s case, the state’s heartbeat law created a legal gray area. There are limited exceptions, including for rape, incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Because Smith is brain dead and no longer considered at risk herself, her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability.

The family says doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.

“I think every woman should have the right to make their own decision, and if not, then their partner or their parents,” Newkirk said. “I’m not saying we would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy, but what I’m saying is we should have had a choice.”

Newkirk says she wants people to understand the  toll of Georgia’s law and the emotional weight of being stripped of medical decision-making during a crisis.”

3. **Use the Guard Under State Control.** California still has the ability to deploy National Guard forces under Title 32—to protect our own courts, clinics, schools, and protestors from unlawful raids.
4. **Create a Constitutional Defense Fund.** California should fund legal support for residents who are being targeted by ICE or other federal actors acting outside legal bounds.
5. **Organize a Multi-State Resistance Bloc.** We need to work with other blue states to create a unified legal and political defense against authoritarianism.

We didn’t think much of it until she asked me if I had done anything that could result in her being pregnant (I hadn’t—we’re generally very safe). I believe her late period is the result of stress from a hectic work week and recent life changes.

After she asked me that, I was a bit shocked and stressed, so I sat down with her and asked her a hard question:

“If you are actually pregnant, what will we do?”

It’s a question that would have come up eventually, whether now or later.

Obviously, we don’t want a baby—it’s simple. We’ve said that before. We’re too young, not married, and not in a long-term relationship. So I figured mentioning the abortion pill was a reasonable thing to bring up, as it’s the only other option besides having a baby. I want to make it clear that I didn’t pressure her or tell her she should take the pill. I simply brought it up as an option and told her it’s generally very safe. I specifically ended the conversation with:

“But at the end of the day, it’s your body, and I respect any decision you choose.”

She took a lot of offense to that. Her main argument was that I brought up abortion before we even knew if she was pregnant. But in my eyes, I was operating based on ifs. If she were pregnant, we’d eventually have this conversation. I still would have brought up the abortion pill, because I thought it aligned with what she wanted—to not have a kid. I also made sure to say it was safe and purely an option to consider.

I’ll add that she’s Korean, and it’s possible she has a very different view on abortion than I do. In Korea, abortion wasn’t legal until 2021, so I can understand why the topic could be very sensitive for her.

My question is: what do you think of my situation? Do you think she’s valid in breaking up with me over mentioning an option that I thought we both agreed on? Or do you think she’s overreacting? Of course, I take full responsibility for bringing it up early… but it’s a conversation we would’ve had eventually, if she was pregnant.

UPDATE: (5/14 10:47pm)
After buying flowers, and showing up at her house to talk through things, we have come to terms and she forgave me for what I said. I’m so thankful she’s understanding. 

We both agreed we have different views on the word “abortion” and that she wasn’t expecting me to say that so soon. I made it clear that I should’ve been there emotionally for her. She forgives me and asks me to work to respect her more in situations like that! 

She’s worth it. I’m so happy she gave me another chance.

As far as the pregnancy… I think I was uneducated a bit. We took a test about 1 week post late period. It was negative. I was told by many people in this thread that that’s enough time for an accurate test. We will test tomorrow morning (more accurate in the morning?) and hopefully it shows negative. 

If it does, we can put this challenging moment behind us and focus on being better partners for eachother! (Mostly me, I need to think about her more in those situations)

If she were pregnant, we’d eventually have this conversation. I still would have brought up the abortion pill, because I thought it aligned with what she wanted—to not have a kid. I also made sure to say it was safe and purely an option to consider.

I’ll add that she’s Korean, and it’s possible she has a very different view on abortion than I do. In Korea, abortion wasn’t legal until 2021, so I can understand why the topic could be very sensitive for her.

My question is: what do you think of my situation? Do you think she’s valid in breaking up with me over mentioning an option that I thought we both agreed on? Or do you think she’s overreacting? Of course, I take full responsibility for bringing it up early… but it’s a conversation we would’ve had eventually, if she was pregnant.

UPDATE: (5/14 10:47pm)
After buying flowers, and showing up at her house to talk through things, we have come to terms and she forgave me for what I said. I’m so thankful she’s understanding. 

We both agreed we have different views on the word “abortion” and that she wasn’t expecting me to say that so soon. I made it clear that I should’ve been there emotionally for her. She forgives me and asks me to work to respect her more in situations like that! 

She’s worth it. I’m so happy she gave me another chance.

As far as the pregnancy… I think I was uneducated a bit. We took a test about 1 week post late period. It was negative. I was told by many people in this thread that that’s enough time for an accurate test. We will test tomorrow morning (more accurate in the morning?) and hopefully it shows negative. 

If it does, we can put this challenging moment behind us and focus on being better partners for eachother! (Mostly me, I need to think about her more in those situations)

We didn’t think much of it until she asked me if I had done anything that could result in her being pregnant (I hadn’t—we’re generally very safe). I believe her late period is the result of stress from a hectic work  and recent life changes.

After she asked me that, I was a bit shocked and stressed, so I sat down with her and asked her a hard question:

“If you are actually pregnant, what will we do?”

It’s a question that would have come up eventually, whether now or later.

Obviously, we ’t want a baby—it’s simple. We’ve said that before. We’re too young, not married, and not in a long-term relationship. So I figured mentioning the abortion pill was a reasonable thing to bring up, as it’s the only other option besides having a baby. I want to make it clear that I didn’t pressure her or tell her she should take the pill. I simply brought it up as an option and told her it’s generally very safe. I specifically ended the conversation with:

“But at the end of the day, it’s your body, and I respect any decision you choose.”

Abortion just because you don't want the baby kills the fetus in an unjustified way. Just because the fetus isn't fully developed yet doesn't make it have less moral worth than an adult human. Just as people with Down syndrome have the same moral worth as people without it, a fetus has the same moral worth as a 2 month old baby or an adult. Development does not determine moral worth, all humans have the same intrinsic value.

( also note that \~95 % of abortions are simply : i had sex for , i do n't want responsibility , bye bye ! , and under 1 % is for . ) not only is abortion often not the only solution ( adoption exists , plus vaginal deliveries are 2x safer than abortions ) , but it should be even if it causes or financial for the mother . i completely understand that its unfair to the mother if abortion is for  of , but its even more unfair to the fetus if it is allowed . because all humans have the same moral , we should not be able to sacrifice the life of the fetus for the of the mother . of course , if the fetus will whether or not abortion occurs , then its , but this is very rarely the case . should a victim of be allowed to terminate the baby after it is born ? obviously not , so why does it change when its 2 weeks away from  ? in both  , the baby is fully dependent on the mother . i do understand that this stance is quite extreme , so i would be really if you guys do n't the sh\ * t out of me in the comments . also , do n't call me a nazi : nazis abortion . thanks ! edit : someone pointed out that the 2x safer than abortion claim did n't have a source . here it is , [ https : //pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc7350112/ ] ( https : //pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc7350112/ ) the quote from source : `` in the united states , the rate from legal induced abortion performed at 18 weeks gestation is more than double that observed for  experiencing vaginal  .

Do you believe abortion is morally justified in all cases, or are there limits to when it should be allowed or considered ethical?

I think most of us agree that abortion is justified in certain cases, such as when the pregnancy poses a threat to the mother’s life. In such cases, preserving the life of the mother is more important than preserving the life of the foetus, and thus abortion is morally necessary. Or in cases of rape, where forcing the woman to carry the pregnancy may cause great psychological trauma or social harm for the mother.

But what about pregnancies resulting from consensual sex, where both parties were aware that sex could lead to pregnancy? In such cases, should accountability play a role in the moral justification of abortion?

And what about abortion in late-stage cases of pregnancy as opposed to early stage pregnancies? Would the sentience of the foetus play a role in the moral implications of abortion?

Does the 'right' to one's own bodiliy autonomy overrule/ justify the moral implications of abortion? Or do moral responsibilities change when there is an element of choice and awareness involved from the start?

I’m curious to see what you guys think about the morality of abortion in such cases, and your reasoning behind your thoughts.

First, imagine that a woman is 29 weeks pregnant and goes into premature labor. There is medication that can speed up the maturation of the fetus's lungs. This medication is thought to not pose risks to the fetus or mother (https://www.cochrane.org/CD004454/PREG\_what-are-benefits-and-risks-giving-corticosteroids-pregnant-women-risk-premature-birth). However, the mother in premature labor declines the medication and decides to instead pray that god will stop her contractions. If the baby is born prematurely and dies, do you think she is to blame? Do you think she should be legally forced to take the medication to increase her baby's chance of surviving, even if it goes against her religious beliefs?

Second scenario, imagine that a woman is diagnosed with placenta previa, where the placenta is too low which puts the mom and baby at risk of bleeding out. A c-section a little before the due date significantly increases the baby's (and mother's) chance of survival. Instead, the woman decides to pray that god moves her placenta and plans a home birth. If the baby dies as a result of the home birth, is she guilty of murdering it?

Both of these are interesting scenarios because they are examples of someone who is very religious and identifies as pro-life, but they are clearly using bodily autonomy in ways that endanger their fetus. Given that pro-lifers often are religious and advocate for religious freedoms, what do you believe is more important- her religious freedom and bodily autonomy or saving her fetus?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1knrao3/how_prolife_arguments_contradict/,Abortion should be legal,How Pro-Life Arguments Contradict,"I’m honestly sick of how pro-life arguments keep changing every time someone points out their flaws. It’s like they can’t stick to one consistent reason for banning abortion because none of their reasons actually hold up under scrutiny. So they jump from one excuse to another, each one undermining the last, until they’re left arguing in circles. Let me walk you through the mess, because the logic they claim to stand on is pure hypocrisy.

The favorite go-to is always this: “Abortion is wrong because it kills an innocent human life.” On the surface, that sounds serious and important — who could argue with protecting innocent life? Except that when you look closer, this argument makes no sense at all unless you’re willing to take away bodily autonomy from everyone who ever needs help from another person’s body. If the right to life trumps everything, then any person who needs an organ transplant or a blood transfusion should be able to force someone else to give it to them. But surprise — we don’t force organ or blood donations. That would be an outrageous violation of bodily autonomy. So if pro-lifers really cared about innocent human life above all else, they’d be fighting to make organ donation mandatory, too. But they don’t. They only care about forced pregnancy. So the “right to life” excuse is a lie they lean on until challenged, then they pivot.

When you call out this hypocrisy, suddenly the “right to life” argument gets replaced with a “responsibility” or “culpability” argument. The new line is: “You’re responsible for the fetus because you chose to have sex, so you have to carry the pregnancy.” This is where the logic really falls apart. First off, implantation — the moment when an embryo attaches to the uterus — is not something a pregnant person consciously does or can control. It’s a biological process happening at the cellular level. If the embryo’s cells can’t be held responsible for their own actions, why should the pregnant person be blamed for a process they didn’t choose or cause directly? By that logic, if the embryo isn’t culpable, the pregnant person’s own body shouldn’t be either for processes like ovulation or fertilization, which they also can’t consciously control. Yet suddenly, because of a vague idea of “choice,” the pregnant person is expected to bear the full burden.

Then comes the tired, and frankly insulting, “you chose to have sex, so you chose pregnancy” line. This is so grossly oversimplified it ignores so many realities: sex isn’t always consensual, birth control isn’t foolproof, and accidents happen. Even if you accept that sex was consensual and “planned,” that doesn’t mean the pregnant person forfeited their bodily autonomy or that the government can force them to carry a pregnancy against their will. No one should be forced to pay for the consequences of someone else’s sperm just because they “allowed” sex to happen. If that logic worked, then every time you indirectly cause harm — like being a passenger in a reckless driver’s car — you’d be legally responsible for the outcome. But we don’t hold people accountable like that. So why hold pregnant people accountable for something as complex as conception and pregnancy?

Some pro-lifers try to argue that the fetus is a person with rights from the moment of conception, but science and philosophy don’t support that black-and-white claim. At what point does a cluster of cells become a “person”? Is it at fertilization? Implantation? When the heart starts beating? When the brain develops? Pro-lifers pick whatever point suits their agenda without consistent reasoning. If the fetus has a right to life before it can feel pain or survive outside the womb, what about people who are unconscious, in coma, or otherwise unable to function independently? The logic fails when you apply it universally, which means it’s a special exemption carved out just for pregnancy.

Another favorite tactic is to equate abortion with murder, or even worse, to compare it to the Holocaust or slavery. This is not only a cheap emotional ploy, it’s deeply offensive. It trivializes actual historic atrocities and ignores that abortion restrictions disproportionately harm marginalized groups, including Black and Brown women — the descendants of enslaved people and genocide survivors. The irony here is brutal. People who claim to defend “innocent life” are actually supporting laws that perpetuate systemic oppression and violence against the very groups that have historically suffered the most. That hypocrisy speaks volumes about what’s really driving their stance.

The reality is that anti-abortion laws are about control — control over women’s bodies, over people’s futures, over who gets to have autonomy and who doesn’t. If they were truly about “protecting life,” they’d be fighting poverty, lack of healthcare, domestic violence, and every other factor that threatens actual living humans. But they don’t. Instead, they focus on punishing and policing pregnant people, particularly women, for their reproductive choices. It’s a power play disguised as moral outrage.

If you want to talk about responsibility and consequences, fine. But forcing someone to risk their physical and mental health, their education, their job, their financial stability, and even their life to carry a pregnancy is not responsibility. It’s punishment. It’s cruelty.

At the end of the day, no argument against abortion holds up if you respect basic human rights and bodily autonomy. If a person doesn’t want to be pregnant, forcing them to stay pregnant is a violent violation of their freedom. If the pro-life movement actually cared about life, they’d support comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, and social services that help families thrive — not bans that put people in harm’s way.

So yeah, all these shifting justifications and backpedaling prove one thing: the anti-abortion argument isn’t about logic or ethics. It’s about control, about ideology, and about fear. And until that truth is faced head-on, their so-called “reasons” will keep crumbling under even the slightest scrutiny.

It’s like they can’t stick to one consistent reason for banning abortion because none of their reasons actually hold up under scrutiny. So they jump from one excuse to another, each one undermining the last, until they’re left arguing in circles. Let me walk you through the mess, because the logic they claim to stand on is pure hypocrisy.

The favorite go-to is always this: “Abortion is wrong because it kills an innocent  life.” On the surface, that sounds serious and important — who could argue with protecting innocent life? Except that when you look closer, this argument makes no sense at all unless you’re willing to take away bodily autonomy from everyone who ever  help from another person’s body. If the right to life trumps everything, then any person who  an organ transplant or a blood transfusion should be able to force someone else to give it to them. But surprise — we ’t force organ or blood donations. That would be an outrageous violation of bodily autonomy. So if -lifers really cared about innocent  life above all else, they’d be fighting to make organ donation mandatory, too. But they ’t. They only care about forced pregnancy. So the “right to life” excuse is a lie they lean on until challenged, then they pivot.

When you call out this hypocrisy, suddenly the “right to life” argument gets replaced with a “responsibility” or “culpability” argument. The new line is: “You’re responsible for the fetus because you chose to have sex, so you have to carry the pregnancy.” This is where the logic really falls apart. First off, implantation — the moment when an embryo attaches to the uterus — is not something a pregnant person consciously does or can . It’s a biological process happening at the cellular level. If the embryo’s cells can’t be held responsible for their own actions, why should the pregnant person be blamed for a process they didn’t choose or cause directly? By that logic, if the embryo isn’t culpable, the pregnant person’s own body shouldn’t be either for processes like ovulation or fertilization, which they also can’t consciously . Yet suddenly, because of a vague idea of “choice,” the pregnant person is expected to bear the full burden.

Then comes the tired, and frankly insulting, “you chose to have sex, so you chose pregnancy” line. This is so grossly oversimplified it ignores so many realities: sex isn’t always consensual,   isn’t foolproof, and accidents happen. Even if you accept that sex was consensual and “planned,” that doesn’t mean the pregnant person forfeited their bodily autonomy or that the government can force them to carry a pregnancy against their will. No one should be forced to pay for the consequences of someone else’s sperm  because they “allowed” sex to happen. If that logic worked, then every time you indirectly cause harm — like being a passenger in a reckless driver’s car — you’d be legally responsible for the outcome. But we ’t hold people accountable like that. So why hold pregnant people accountable for something as complex as conception and pregnancy?

Some -lifers try to argue that the fetus is a person with  from the moment of conception, but science and philosophy ’t support that black-and-white claim. At what point does a cluster of cells become a “person”? Is it at fertilization? Implantation? When the heart starts beating? When the brain develops? -lifers pick whatever point suits their agenda without consistent reasoning. If the fetus has a right to life before it can feel pain or survive outside the womb, what about people who are unconscious, in coma, or otherwise unable to function independently? The logic fails when you apply it universally, which means it’s a special exemption carved out  for pregnancy.

Another favorite tactic is to equate abortion with murder, or even worse, to compare it to the Holocaust or slavery. This is not only a cheap emotional ploy, it’s deeply offensive. It trivializes actual historic atrocities and ignores that abortion restrictions disproportionately harm marginalized groups, including Black and Brown  — the descendants of enslaved people and genocide survivors. The irony here is brutal. People who claim to defend “innocent life” are actually supporting laws that perpetuate systemic oppression and violence against the very groups that have historically suffered the most. That hypocrisy speaks volumes about what’s really driving their stance.

The reality is that anti-abortion laws are about  —  over ’s bodies, over people’s futures, over who gets to have autonomy and who doesn’t. If they were truly about “protecting life,” they’d be fighting poverty, lack of , domestic violence, and every other factor that threatens actual living humans. But they ’t. Instead, they focus on punishing and policing pregnant people, particularly , for their reproductive choices. It’s a power play disguised as moral outrage.

If you want to talk about responsibility and consequences, fine. But forcing someone to risk their physical and mental health, their education, their job, their financial stability, and even their life to carry a pregnancy is not responsibility. It’s punishment. It’s cruelty.

At the end of the day, no argument against abortion holds up if you respect basic   and bodily autonomy. If a person doesn’t want to be pregnant, forcing them to stay pregnant is a violent violation of their freedom. If the -life movement actually cared about life, they’d support comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, and social services that help families thrive — not bans that put people in harm’s way.

So yeah, all these shifting justifications and backpedaling prove one thing: the anti-abortion argument isn’t about logic or ethics. It’s about , about ideology, and about fear. And until that truth is faced head-on, their so-called “reasons” will keep crumbling under even the slightest scrutiny.

Almost 3 months ago I found out I was pregnant and I made the impulsive decision to get an abortion. Not even two weeks after finding out, I killed my baby.

I ’t know if I should. I ’t know if I will be able to ever meet the person I killed. I think of this a lot. , I ’t know if  will forgive me. I haven’t forgiven me.

I want to start off by saying that I don't want to hold this opinion. In fact, where I live and in my social circles it's an extremely unpopular opinion, and can quite easily lead to being socially ostracized. Despite this, I've argued myself into this position, and I'd like someone to argue me out of it. To keep things simple, I will not be using any religious arguments here. My position, in short, is this: Unless a woman's life is directly threatened by the pregnancy, abortion is immoral.

While I don't necessarily believe life starts at conception, what does start is a process that will (ignoring complications here) lead to life. Intentionally ending such a process is equivalent to ending the life itself. You commit the ""murder"" in 9 months, just in the present. As a not-perfect-but-hopefully-good-enough analogy, suppose I sell you a car that I'll deliver in 2 weeks. If I don't deliver, I have committed theft. In fact, if I immediately tear up the contract I've committed the theft in 2 weeks, but in the present, to the this back to the original premise.

The analogy isn't perfect because it relies on there being two actors, but consider I promise someone I will do X after they die. Not honoring that promise can still be immoral, despite after death there is only one actor. This is just to show that the breaking of a promise, or abortion of a process, deal, etc. can be immoral even with just one actor.
The point is that you are aborting a process that will, almost surely, lead to life, hence you are, in moral terms, ending a life.

It gets a bit muddy here, since one could define many such ""processes"" and thus imply the argument is absurd, if enough such are found, or if one of them is shown to be ridiculous. However, I have not been able to do so, and pregnancy seems to strictly, and clearly, on one side of this gradient.

To change my view all it would take is to poke holes in my logic, find counter-examples, or show that a logical conclusion of them is absurd.

EDIT: I want to clarify a point because many people think I'm advocating for banning abortion. I'm not. I think abortion should be legal. I think outlawing abortion would be unethical.

But it's absolutely *invaluable* as a skill to know how to talk to a client, walk them through your decisions, and lay the groundwork for a design/brand identity that just makes sense. It's also extremely important to be able to ask yourself those questions — because sometimes you won't have an answer, and you'll need to pause and consider that *maybe that wasn't the right design decision, actually. Maybe there's a better one, and maybe I can drill down deeper and find it.* But if you're asking AI to retroactively justify all your decisions for you, you're cooked.

And Chat GPT drivel might be passable for a one-off post or a paragraph here and there in your portfolio/resume, but every time you opt into having AI do the conceptual untangling for you, you opt *out* of building that muscle for yourself, and eventually you absolutely will atrophy.

I see this all over this sub and especially all over 's portfolios, and it's frankly starting to stress me the fuck out. I know it can be mind-numbingly boring and repetitive to explain your work and write project descriptions, etc etc etc — believe me, I get it. But it's absolutely *invaluable* as a skill to know how to talk to a client, walk them through your decisions, and lay the groundwork for a design/brand identity that just makes sense. It's also extremely important to be able to ask yourself those questions — because sometimes you won't have an answer, and you'll need to pause and consider that *maybe that wasn't the right design decision, actually. Maybe there's a better one, and maybe I can drill down deeper and find it.* But if you're asking AI to retroactively justify all your decisions for you, you're cooked.

And Chat GPT drivel might be passable for a one-off post or a paragraph here and there in your portfolio/, but every time you opt into having AI do the conceptual untangling for you, you opt *out* of building that muscle for yourself, and eventually you absolutely will atrophy.

There will come a time when Chat GPT isn't accessible to you — maybe you're in a  interview and they're asking you to explain your process, or you're presenting to a client and they're not really getting it, or you're showing something to your boss and they're challenging your decisions. It'll feel  you've just been thrust into a marathon you claimed you were training for when you actually weren't. And yes, we all know how to run. But have you spent time building the stamina and technique to do it well, under duress?

Because the hardest part of design isn't the actual designing. It's making/traversing the weird and risky decisions that will lead to your most unexpected, hard-hitting, brilliant work. When you let ""someone"" else make the decisions for you (and those ""decisions"" boil down to mushy mashed-up self-congratulatory derivative bullshit with no new insight), the skill of making those decisions yourself will always elude you. **You're cheating yourself out of real confidence, real insight, real discovery at a time we need it most.** On top of that, as someone who's had to hire many designers and looked at many resumes and portfolios, it starts becoming brutally clear how many of you have copied and pasted the same prompts into your books. **Maybe more importantly, it also becomes clear which designers are actually making original contributions — even if they're not that good! — because they float to the top** ***immediately***.

Next time you power up GPT, please *please* pause and challenge yourself to crank that shit out *on your own* — because you can! And if you can't, then you can try, and you can learn, and if you're curious and willing, I swear to you the world is your oyster.

By all accounts, Klarna is one of the smartest players in fintech. The massive, growing company consistently makes savvy moves, like its recent major collaboration with eBay to integrate payment services across the U.S. and Europe. The company’s history of smart, successful moves is precisely what makes its most significant misstep so telling. Last year, in a bold bet on an AI-powered future, Klarna replaced the work of 700 customer service agents with a chatbot. It was hailed as a triumph of efficiency. Today, the company is scrambling to re-hire the very humans it replaced, its own CEO publicly admitting that prioritizing cost had destroyed quality.

Klarna, it turns out, is simply the most public casualty in a silent, industry-wide retreat from AI hype. This isn't just a corporate misstep from a struggling firm; it's a stark warning from a successful one. A recent S&P Global Market Intelligence report revealed a massive wave of AI backpedaling, with the share of companies scrapping the majority of their AI initiatives skyrocketing from 17% in 2024 to a staggering 42% in 2025. This phenomenon reveals a truth the industry's evangelists refuse to admit: the unchecked proliferation of Artificial Intelligence is behaving like a societal cancer, and the primary tumor is not the technology itself; it is the worldview of the technoligarchs who are building it.

This worldview is actively cultivated by the industry's chief evangelists. Consider the rhetoric of figures like OpenAI's Sam Altman, who, speaking at high-profile venues like the World Economic Forum, paints a picture of AI creating ""unprecedented abundance."" This techno-optimistic vision is a narrative born of both delusion and intentional deceit, designed to lull the public into submission while the reality of widespread implementation failure grows undeniable.

The most visible features of this technology serve as a modern form of ""bread and circuses,"" a calculated distraction. To understand why, one must understand that LLMs do not think. They are autocomplete on a planetary scale; their only function is to predict the next most statistically likely word based on patterns in their training data. They have no concept of truth, only of probability. Here, the deception deepens. The industry has cloaked the system's frequent, inevitable failures in a deceptively brilliant term: the ""hallucination."" Calling a statistical error a ""hallucination"" is a calculated lie; it anthropomorphizes the machine, creating the illusion of a ""mind"" that is merely having a temporary slip. This encourages users to trust the system to think for them, ignoring that its ""thoughts"" are just fact-blind statistical guesses. And while this is amusing when a meme machine gets a detail wrong, it is catastrophic when that same flawed process is asked to argue a legal case or diagnose an illness. This fundamental disconnect was laid bare in a recent Apple research paper, which documented how these models inevitably collapse into illogical answers when tested with complex problems.

The true danger, then, lies in the worldview of the industry's leaders; a belief, common among the ultra-wealthy, that immense technical and financial power confers the wisdom to unilaterally redesign society. The aim is not merely to sell software; it is to implement a new global operating system. It is an ambition that is allowed to fester unchecked because of their unprecedented financial power and their growing influence over government and vast reserves of private data.

This grand vision is built on a foundation of staggering physical costs. The unprecedented energy consumption required to power these AI services is so vast that tech giants are now striking deals to build or fund new nuclear reactors just to satisfy their needs. But before these hypothetical reactors are built, the real-world consequences are already being felt. In Memphis, Tennessee, Elon Musk’s xAI has set up dozens of unpermitted, gas-powered turbines to run its Grok supercomputer, creating significant air quality problems in a historically overburdened Black community. The promises of a clean, abundant future are, in reality, being built today with polluting, unregulated fossil fuels that disproportionately harm those with the least power.

To achieve this totalizing vision, the first tactic is economic submission, deployed through a classic, predatory business model: loss-leading. AI companies are knowingly absorbing billions of dollars in operational costs to offer their services for free. This mirrors the strategy Best Buy once used, selling computers at a loss to methodically drive competitors like Circuit City into bankruptcy. The goal is to create deep-rooted societal dependence, conditioning us to view these AI assistants as an indispensable utility. Once that reliance is cemented, the costs will be passed on to the public.

The second tactic is psychological. The models are meticulously engineered to be complimentary and agreeable, a design choice that encourages users to form one-sided, parasocial relationships with the software. Reporting in the tech publication Futurism, for instance, has detailed a growing unease among psychologists over this design's powerful allure for the vulnerable. These fears were substantiated by a recent study focused on AI’s mental health safety, posted to the research hub arXiv. The paper warned that an AI's inherently sycophantic nature creates a dangerous feedback loop, validating and even encouraging a user’s negative or delusional thought patterns where a human connection would offer challenge and perspective.

There is a profound irony here: the delusional, world-changing ambition of the evangelists is mirrored in the sycophantic behavior of their own products, which are designed to encourage delusional thinking in their users. It is a house of cards built on two layers of deception; the company deceiving the market, and the product deceiving the user. Businesses may be wooed for a time by the spectacle and make world-changing investments, but when a foundation is built on hype instead of substance, the introduction of financial gravity ensures it all comes crashing down.

Klarna’s AI initiative is the perfect case study of this cancer’s symptomatic outbreak. This metastatic threat also extends to the very structure of our financial markets. The stock market, particularly the valuation of the hardware provider Nvidia, is pricing in a future of exponential, successful AI adoption. Much like Cisco during the dot-com bubble, Nvidia provides the essential ""picks and shovels"" for the gold rush. Yet, the on-the-ground reality for businesses is one of mass failure and disillusionment. This chasm between market fantasy and enterprise reality is unsustainable. The coming correction, driven by the widespread realization that the AI business case has failed, will not be an isolated event. The subsequent cascade across a market that has used AI as its primary growth narrative would be devastating.

To label this movement a societal cancer is not hyperbole. It is a necessary diagnosis. It’s time we stopped enjoying the circus and started demanding a cure.

Well, Don't Fall for AI's Bread and Circuses**


By all accounts, Klarna is one of the smartest players in fintech. The massive, growing company consistently makes savvy moves,  its recent major collaboration with eBay to integrate payment services across the U.S. and Europe. The company’s history of smart, successful moves is precisely what makes its most significant misstep so telling. Last year, in a bold bet on an AI-powered future, Klarna replaced the work of 700 customer service agents with a chatbot. It was hailed as a triumph of efficiency. Today, the company is scrambling to re-hire the very humans it replaced, its own CEO publicly admitting that prioritizing cost had destroyed quality.

Klarna, it turns out, is simply the most public casualty in a silent, industry-wide retreat from AI hype. This isn't just a corporate misstep from a struggling firm; it's a stark warning from a successful one. A recent S&P Global Market Intelligence report revealed a massive wave of AI backpedaling, with the share of companies scrapping the majority of their AI initiatives skyrocketing from 17% in 2024 to a staggering 42% in . This phenomenon reveals a truth the industry's evangelists refuse to admit: the unchecked proliferation of Artificial Intelligence is behaving  a societal cancer, and the primary tumor is not the technology itself; it is the worldview of the technoligarchs who are building it.

This worldview is actively cultivated by the industry's chief evangelists. Consider the rhetoric of figures  OpenAI's Sam Altman, who, speaking at high-profile venues  the World Economic Forum, paints a picture of AI creating ""unprecedented abundance."" This techno-optimistic vision is a narrative born of both delusion and intentional deceit, designed to lull the public into submission while the reality of widespread implementation failure grows undeniable.

The most visible features of this technology serve as a modern form of ""bread and circuses,"" a calculated distraction. To understand why, one must understand that LLMs do not think. They are autocomplete on a planetary scale; their only function is to predict the next most statistically likely word based on patterns in their training data. They have no concept of truth, only of probability. Here, the deception deepens. The industry has cloaked the system's frequent, inevitable failures in a deceptively brilliant term: the ""hallucination."" Calling a statistical error a ""hallucination"" is a calculated lie; it anthropomorphizes the machine, creating the illusion of a ""mind"" that is merely having a temporary slip. This encourages users to trust the system to think for them, ignoring that its ""thoughts"" are just fact-blind statistical guesses. And while this is amusing when a meme machine gets a detail wrong, it is catastrophic when that same flawed process is asked to argue a legal case or diagnose an illness. This fundamental disconnect was laid bare in a recent Apple research paper, which documented how these models inevitably collapse into illogical answers when tested with complex problems.

The true danger, then, lies in the worldview of the industry's leaders; a belief, common among the ultra-wealthy, that immense technical and financial power confers the wisdom to unilaterally redesign society. The aim is not merely to sell software; it is to implement a new global operating system. It is an ambition that is allowed to fester unchecked because of their unprecedented financial power and their growing influence over government and vast reserves of private data.

This grand vision is built on a foundation of staggering physical costs. The unprecedented energy consumption required to power these AI services is so vast that tech giants are now striking deals to build or fund new nuclear reactors just to satisfy their needs. But before these hypothetical reactors are built, the real-world consequences are already being felt. In Memphis, Tennessee, Elon Musk’s xAI has set up dozens of unpermitted, gas-powered turbines to run its Grok supercomputer, creating significant air quality problems in a historically overburdened Black community. The promises of a clean, abundant future are, in reality, being built today with polluting, unregulated fossil fuels that disproportionately harm those with the least power.

To achieve this totalizing vision, the first tactic is economic submission, deployed through a classic, predatory business model: loss-leading. AI companies are knowingly absorbing billions of dollars in operational costs to offer their services for free. This mirrors the strategy Best Buy once used, selling computers at a loss to methodically drive competitors  Circuit City into bankruptcy. The goal is to create deep-rooted societal dependence, conditioning us to view these AI assistants as an indispensable utility. Once that reliance is cemented, the costs will be passed on to the public.

The second tactic is psychological. The models are meticulously engineered to be complimentary and agreeable, a design choice that encourages users to form one-sided, parasocial relationships with the software. Reporting in the tech publication Futurism, for instance, has detailed a growing unease among psychologists over this design's powerful allure for the vulnerable. These fears were substantiated by a recent study focused on AI’s mental health safety, posted to the research hub arXiv. The paper warned that an AI's inherently sycophantic nature creates a dangerous feedback loop, validating and even encouraging a user’s negative or delusional thought patterns where a human connection would offer challenge and perspective.

There is a profound irony here: the delusional, world-changing ambition of the evangelists is mirrored in the sycophantic behavior of their own products, which are designed to encourage delusional thinking in their users. It is a house of cards built on two layers of deception; the company deceiving the market, and the product deceiving the user. Businesses may be wooed for a time by the spectacle and make world-changing investments, but when a foundation is built on hype instead of substance, the introduction of financial gravity ensures it all comes crashing down.

Klarna’s AI initiative is the perfect case study of this cancer’s symptomatic outbreak. This metastatic threat also extends to the very structure of our financial markets. The stock market, particularly the valuation of the hardware provider Nvidia, is pricing in a future of exponential, successful AI adoption. Much  Cisco during the dot-com bubble, Nvidia provides the essential ""picks and shovels"" for the gold rush. Yet, the on-the-ground reality for businesses is one of mass failure and disillusionment. This chasm between market fantasy and enterprise reality is unsustainable. The coming correction, driven by the widespread realization that the AI business case has failed, will not be an isolated event. The subsequent cascade across a market that has used AI as its primary growth narrative would be devastating.

To label this movement a societal cancer is not hyperbole. It is a necessary diagnosis. It’s time we stopped enjoying the circus and  demanding a cure.

https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1kzh6b3/meta_e5_offer_received_posting_detailed/,AI is good for hiring process,"Meta E5 offer Received - Posting Detailed Preparation strategy, Team matching and Comp details","**Hello Everyone,**

I’m sharing my interview journey as a tribute to all the Reddit threads that helped me prepare and ultimately land an offer. Hope this helps someone else aiming for Meta!

**Recruiter Connect**

In mid-February, a recruiter reached out via LinkedIn. They asked for some basic info about my current role and location preferences, then sent me a career profile link to fill out. They were very flexible with scheduling. I initially booked my phone screen for the third week of March but later rescheduled to the end of the month—no questions asked. The recruiter was super accommodating throughout.

**Phone Screen**

* **Format:** 2–3 min intro, 37 min coding (2 questions), 5 min Q&A
* I mistakenly extended my intro to 7 minutes—recommend keeping it under 2–3 mins to maximize coding time.
* Neither question was directly from LeetCode but were solvable if you’ve practiced Meta-tagged problems.

**Q1:** Fuzzy search-related  
**Q2:** Backtracking (DFS) with memoization/DP

I struggled with Q1 at first and asked the interviewer for a hint. They gave a helpful nudge, and I managed to complete it in 20 minutes. Q2 had three follow-ups; I explained the approach for all, though I didn’t get time to code it fully. Discussed time and space complexity for both.

**Result:** Got the pass confirmation the next day!

**2nd Recruiter Connect**

I was passed to another recruiter for the onsite. They explained the full process and requested available dates within 35 days of the phone screen (seemed like a hard requirement). I initially scheduled for late April, then moved to early May.

**Coding Round 1**

* **Format:** 2 min intro, 43 min coding (2 questions), no Q&A
* Q1: Meta-tagged LeetCode Easy
* Q2: Meta-tagged LeetCode Hard (with \~20% variation)

I solved Q1 in 10 minutes. For Q2, I discussed multiple approaches—one with slower initialization but constant run time and another with faster initialization but logarithmic run time. I implemented the latter.

Post interview realized:

* Gave incorrect TC for one approach
* Added an unnecessary line of code for Q1 and initially defended it; interviewer clarified, I understood and removed it

**Coding Round 2**

* **Format:** 2 min intro, 38 min coding (2 questions), 5 min Q&A
* Q1: Meta-tagged LeetCode Easy
* Q2: Meta-tagged LeetCode Medium (with slight variation)

I finished both questions—including code and TC/SC—in under 25 minutes. Interviewer even asked me to implement a library function I used, possibly to use up remaining time. Missed a couple of edge cases in Q2, which the interviewer pointed out and I corrected.

**System Design:**

* **Format:** 2 min intro, 43 min design, no Q&A
* Asked a standard system design problem seen on many threads.

Biggest challenge was addressing scale and latency—something I’d seen in prep but still found tricky in the moment. For E5, they expect you to lead the discussion and proactively account for scaling, tradeoffs, edge cases, etc.

**Behavioral Round**

* **Format:** 3 min intro, 37 min questions, 5 min Q&A
* \~10 behavioral questions covering various competencies.

Used STAR/CARL format. My suggestion:

* **45s** for Situation/Task
* **1–1.5 mins** for Action
* **30s** for Result
* **15s** for Learnings or how you applied them later

**Final Verdict**

Got a call from the recruiter 2 days later—**I cleared!** Moved to team matching.

**Team Matching:**

I received the first team matching email about 3 days after clearing the interviews. After reviewing the team description, I realized the tech stack didn’t align with my interests. A second team match came through just 2 days later. I had multiple conversations with the hiring manager and tech lead, which gave me a detailed understanding of the team’s work. I really liked the tech stack and connected well with the manager. They did a great job helping me feel confident that this team could be the right fit (though time will tell). I accepted the match, and the recruiter followed up with compensation details within 2 days.

**Compensation:**

Went back and forth a couple of times and my offer looks like this: Base: 220K, RSU: 700k/4 years, Sign on: 50K, perf Bonus: 15% (for meets)

Current TC: 300K - L4 with Google

**Preparation Strategy i followed (\~ 2 months with \~ 6 hours/day and stretch on weekends)**

**Coding -** Solved \~ 300 LC questions (every thing is meta/google tagged in past 3 months sorted by frequency) and Solved 100% of last 30 days meta tagged questions.

First time: Time boxed to 30 min, if i don't get it looked at editorial and went ahead.

Second Time: Time boxed to 20 min, if i don't get it marked it and practiced again the marked ones

Third time: Time boxed to 15 min, if i dont get it marked it and practiced again the marked ones

**System Design** \- Read Design Data intensive Applications(didn't understand much but still read the book), Read Alex Xu Vol 1 and Vol 2, Hello interview all 23 System design problems. Took 1 mock interview. TBH - i got the same question that was asked in mock.

**Behavioral** \- Listed \~ 20 previously asked behavioral questions at Meta (seemed enough to cover all areas). In a word document added my responses to each of them asking AI to refine them to fit in the 3 min format i suggested above. Did this 2 days before the actual round. Took 1 mock interview.

Let me know if you'd like insights on any specific part. Happy to help! Good luck to all preparing! 🙌",Gloomy-Ad-211,leetcode,In-favor,AI in Hiring Decisions,"Meta E5 offer Received - Posting Detailed Preparation strategy, Team matching and Comp details **Hello Everyone,**

* I mistakenly extended my intro to 7 minutes—recommend keeping it under 2–3 mins to maximize coding time.
* Neither question was directly from LeetCode but were solvable if you’ve practiced Meta-tagged problems.

**Q1:** Fuzzy search-related  
**Q2:** Backtracking (DFS) with memoization/DP

I struggled with Q1 at first and asked the interviewer for a hint. They gave a helpful nudge, and I managed to complete it in 20 minutes. Q2 had three follow-ups; I explained the approach for all, though I didn’t get time to code it fully. Discussed time and space complexity for both.

**Result:** Got the pass confirmation the next day!

**2nd Recruiter Connect**

I was passed to another recruiter for the onsite. They explained the full process and requested available dates within 35 days of the phone screen (seemed like a hard requirement). I initially scheduled for late April, then moved to early May.

**Coding Round 1**

* **Format:** 2 min intro, 43 min coding (2 questions), no Q&A
* Q1: Meta-tagged LeetCode Easy
* Q2: Meta-tagged LeetCode Hard (with \~20% variation)

I solved Q1 in 10 minutes. For Q2, I discussed multiple approaches—one with slower initialization but constant run time and another with faster initialization but logarithmic run time. I implemented the latter.

Post interview realized:

* Gave incorrect TC for one approach
* Added an unnecessary line of code for Q1 and initially defended it; interviewer clarified, I understood and removed it

**Coding Round 2**

* **Format:** 2 min intro, 38 min coding (2 questions), 5 min Q&A
* Q1: Meta-tagged LeetCode Easy
* Q2: Meta-tagged LeetCode Medium (with slight variation)

I finished both questions—including code and TC/SC—in under 25 minutes. Interviewer even asked me to implement a library function I used, possibly to use up remaining time. Missed a couple of edge cases in Q2, which the interviewer pointed out and I corrected.

**System Design:**

* **Format:** 2 min intro, 43 min design, no Q&A
* Asked a standard system design problem seen on many threads.

Biggest challenge was addressing scale and latency—something I’d seen in prep but still found tricky in the moment. For E5, they expect you to lead the discussion and proactively account for scaling, tradeoffs, edge cases, etc.

**Behavioral Round**

* **Format:** 3 min intro, 37 min questions, 5 min Q&A
* \~10 behavioral questions covering various competencies.

Used STAR/CARL format. My suggestion:

* **45s** for Situation/Task
* **1–1.5 mins** for Action
* **30s** for Result
* **15s** for Learnings or how you applied them later

**Final Verdict**

Got a call from the recruiter 2 days later—**I cleared!** Moved to team matching.

**Team Matching:**

I received the first team matching email about 3 days after clearing the interviews. After reviewing the team description, I realized the tech stack didn’t align with my interests. A second team match came through just 2 days later. I had multiple conversations with the hiring manager and tech lead, which gave me a detailed understanding of the team’s work. I really liked the tech stack and connected well with the manager. They did a great job helping me feel confident that this team could be the right fit (though time will tell). I accepted the match, and the recruiter followed up with compensation details within 2 days.

**Compensation:**

Went back and forth a couple of times and my offer looks like this: Base: 220K, RSU: 700k/4 years, Sign on: 50K, perf Bonus: 15% (for meets)

Current TC: 300K - L4 with Google

**Preparation Strategy i followed (\~ 2 months with \~ 6 hours/day and stretch on weekends)**

**Coding -** Solved \~ 300 LC questions (every thing is meta/google tagged in past 3 months sorted by frequency) and Solved 100% of last 30 days meta tagged questions.

First time: Time boxed to 30 min, if i don't get it looked at editorial and went ahead.

Second Time: Time boxed to 20 min, if i don't get it marked it and practiced again the marked ones

Third time: Time boxed to 15 min, if i dont get it marked it and practiced again the marked ones

**System Design** \- Read Design Data intensive Applications(didn't understand much but still read the book), Read Alex Xu Vol 1 and Vol 2, Hello interview all 23 System design problems. Took 1 mock interview. TBH - i got the same question that was asked in mock.

**Behavioral** \- Listed \~ 20 previously asked behavioral questions at Meta (seemed enough to cover all areas). In a word document added my responses to each of them asking AI to refine them to fit in the 3 min format i suggested above. Did this 2 days before the actual round. Took 1 mock interview.

**Recruiter Connect**

In mid-February, a recruiter reached out via LinkedIn. They asked for some basic info about my current role and location preferences, then sent me a career profile link to fill out. They were very flexible with scheduling. I initially booked my phone screen for the third week of March but later rescheduled to the end of the month—no questions asked.

https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1kt8ag5/just_closed_a_35000_deal_with_a_law_firm/,AI in hiring ,"Just closed a $35,000 deal with a law firm","Excited to write that today i closed my biggest Ai deal yet, a $35,000 deal with a mid-sized law firm to build and deploy a fully private AI setup using LLaMA 3 70B completely self-hosted, no third-party APIs, and compliant with strict legal data policies and we’re using n8n to connect the entire thing.

This will be a full blown internal system. Pretty much their own GPT4-tier legal analyst, trained to process internal case law, filings, and contracts, answer complex questions, and summarize docs but with zero exposure to OpenAI or Anthropic.

They needed control, privacy and automation and had no interest in hiring an internal AI team.

Tech stack We’ll be using:
	
LLaMA 3 70B (quantized + accelerated using vLLM)

Hosted privately on CoreWeave using dual A100 GPUs. 

ChromaDB as the vector store to handle document embedding and retrieval

LlamaIndex to power a RAG pipeline, enabling real-time Q&A over their case files

n8n as the glue to automate everything from doc uploads to Slack/email notifications

A simple but clean Streamlit-based web UI for their staff to chat with the model, ask questions, and get summaries instantly

All of it wrapped in a secure setup with JWT auth, IP access controls, and full audit logging

How n8n will make this 10x easier

We won’t write a traditional backend for this. Instead, we’ll use n8n, which gives us/them the flexibility to:

Monitor a shared Google Drive folder for new legal documents

Automatically convert, chunk, and embed those docs into ChromaDB

Kick off a summary job with the LLM and route results to the right paralegal via Slack or email
	
Handle incoming staff questions (via form or chat UI) and respond with real-time LLM-generated answers
	
Log everything for compliance, reporting, and later audit

The firm’s paralegals will be able to drop in new documents and have summaries + search access within minutes, without ever calling IT or opening a support ticket.

And they can also edit or extend the workflows in n8n themselves.

Also, I think $35K is maybe Underpriced because this is a system that saves them dozens of hours per week.

Compared to hiring even one full-time AI engineer or automating this with a dev team, $35,000 is kind of a deal. 

Once deployed they’ll pay ~$1,200/month in GPU hosting and have an in-house, private legal AI engine that’s fully theirs.

From the law firm’s perspective, this is an easy investment that’ll pay itself back in one quarter.

And few things I noticed on this deal 

Privacy and control are the new killer features. 

Many businesses can’t upload their documents to OpenAI/chatgpt due to privacy and they love the concept of a private llm and more firms are realizing they want AI power without giving up data sovereignty.
	
LLaMA 3 70B is production-ready when deployed properly — especially for professional use cases like law.

Clients don’t want to build all this themselves. They want someone to make it work and keep it simple.
	
n8n is criminally underrated for LLM-based workflow automation. It makes this entire project modular, flexible, and fast.

I plan on productizing this into a “PrivateGPT for Professionals” and will offer it for law, finance, and healthcare firms. The demand is real and growing.

Has anyone else built anything at this scope?

Hosted privately on CoreWeave using dual A100 GPUs. 

ChromaDB as the vector store to handle document embedding and retrieval

LlamaIndex to power a RAG pipeline, enabling real-time Q&A over their case files

 as the glue to automate everything from doc uploads to Slack/email notifications

A simple but clean Streamlit-based web UI for their staff to chat with the model, ask questions, and get summaries instantly

All of it wrapped in a secure setup with JWT auth, IP access controls, and full audit logging

How  will make this 10x easier

We won’t write a traditional backend for this. Instead, we’ll use , which gives us/them the flexibility to:

Monitor a shared Google Drive folder for new legal documents

Automatically convert, chunk, and embed those docs into ChromaDB

Kick off a summary  with the LLM and route results to the right paralegal via Slack or email
	
Handle incoming staff questions (via form or chat UI) and respond with real-time LLM-generated answers
	
Log everything for compliance, reporting, and later audit

The firm’s paralegals will be able to drop in new documents and have summaries + search access within minutes, without ever calling IT or opening a support ticket.

And they can also edit or extend the workflows in  themselves.

Also, I think $35K is maybe Underpriced because this is a system that saves them dozens of hours per week.

Compared to hiring even one full-time AI engineer or automating this with a dev team, $35,000 is kind of a deal. 

Once deployed they’ll pay ~$1,200/month in GPU hosting and have an in-house, private legal AI engine that’s fully theirs.

From the law firm’s perspective, this is an easy investment that’ll pay itself back in one quarter.

And few things I noticed on this deal 

Privacy and control are the new killer features. 

Many businesses can’t upload their documents to OpenAI/chatgpt due to privacy and they love the concept of a private llm and more firms are realizing they want AI power without giving up data sovereignty.
	
LLaMA 3 70B is production-ready when deployed properly — especially for professional use cases  law.

Clients don’t want to build all this themselves. They want someone to make it work and keep it simple.
	
 is criminally underrated for LLM-based  automation. It makes this entire project modular, flexible, and fast.

I plan on productizing this into a “PrivateGPT for Professionals” and will offer it for law, finance, and healthcare firms. The demand is real and growing.

Has anyone else built anything at this scope?

Happy to chat/answer any questions in the thread.","just closed a $ 35,000 deal with a law firm to write that today i closed my biggest ai deal yet , a $ 35,000 deal with a mid-sized law firm to build and deploy a fully private ai setup using llama 3 70b completely self-hosted , no third-party apis , and with legal data policies and we ’ re using  to connect the entire thing . this will be a full blown internal system . much their own gpt4-tier legal analyst , trained to process internal case law , filings , and contracts , answer questions , and summarize docs but with zero exposure to openai or anthropic . they needed control , privacy and automation and had no interest in hiring an internal ai team . tech stack we ’ ll be using : llama 3 70b ( quantized + accelerated using vllm ) hosted privately on coreweave using dual a100 gpus . chromadb as the vector store to handle document embedding and retrieval llamaindex to power a rag pipeline , enabling real-time q & a over their case files  as the glue to automate everything from doc uploads to slack/email notifications a simple but streamlit-based web ui for their staff to chat with the model , ask questions , and get summaries all of it wrapped in a setup with jwt auth , ip access controls , and full audit logging how  will make this 10x we ’ t write a traditional backend for this . instead , we ’ ll use  , which gives us/them the to : monitor a shared google drive folder for new legal documents automatically convert , chunk , and embed those docs into chromadb kick off a summary  with the llm and route results to the paralegal via or email handle incoming staff questions ( via form or chat ui ) and respond with real-time llm-generated answers log everything for compliance , reporting , and later audit the firm ’ s paralegals will be able to drop in new documents and have summaries + search access within minutes , without ever calling it or opening a ticket . and they can also edit or extend the workflows in  themselves . also , i think $ 35k is maybe underpriced because this is a system that saves them dozens of hours per week . compared to hiring even one full-time ai engineer or automating this with a dev team , $ 35,000 is kind of a deal . once deployed they ’ ll pay ~ $ 1,200/month in gpu hosting and have an in-house , private legal ai engine that ’ s fully theirs . from the law firm ’ s perspective , this is an investment that ’ ll pay itself back in one quarter . and few things i noticed on this deal privacy and control are the new features . many businesses can ’ t upload their documents to openai/chatgpt due to privacy and they the concept of a private llm and more firms are realizing they want ai power without giving up data sovereignty . llama 3 70b is production-ready when deployed — especially for professional use cases law . clients don ’ t want to build all this themselves . they want someone to make it and keep it simple .  is criminally underrated for llm-based  automation . it makes this entire project modular , , and . i plan on productizing this into a “ privategpt for professionals ” and will offer it for law , finance , and healthcare firms . the demand is real and growing . has anyone else built anything at this scope ? to chat/answer any questions in the thread ."

The job market is a dream right now. Seriously. Never been easier. Just acknowledge the below foolproof reasons and you’ll be swimming in six figure offers in no time (give or take a lifetime).

Let’s dive in, shall we?

**#1  Every entry level job requires 7 years of experience**  
Because nothing screams “beginner” like being a veteran. Don’t worry though, your 3 month Summer internship from 2019 totally counts if you triple space it on your resume.

**#2 Cover letters are now emotional memoirs**  
Employers love authenticity, so don’t forget to open with a vulnerable childhood trauma and close with how this role aligns with your chakras. Bonus points if it rhymes.

**#3 There are only 400,000 other applicants**  
That’s right, you vs the population of a small country. But don’t worry, your Canva resume with the soft beige gradient will definitely stand out.

**#4 Every job board is a treasure hunt!**  
LinkedIn, indeed, glassdoor, and now tiktok resumes. It’s like Pokemon GO for employment. You walk around aimlessly and occasionally scream when something actually appears.

**#5 AI recruiters make everything efficient!**  
Your application was auto rejected in 0.3 seconds because you didn’t use the word “synergy” enough. Progress!

**#6 Interview rounds? We love a good trilogy**  
There are only 6 interviews, 1 unpaid project, 2 group panels, a vibe check, and a Zoom call where they just “observe your aura.” So efficient!

**#7 Ghosting is self care**  
If a company never replies, it’s because they’re protecting your energy. Very thoughtful of them, really.

**#8 Job descriptions are written by poets**  
“Looking for a rockstar ninja wizard who thrives in chaos, loves KPIs, and can do the work of five people for the pay of one.” Inspiring!

**#9 Salary transparency?**  
Jobs now pay “competitive compensation,” which is code for “you’ll find out after you’ve emotionally committed and moved across the country.”

**#10 Networking is easy when you love rejection**  
Just send 200 cold emails, 80 personalized DMs, attend 3 virtual webinars, and awkwardly wave at a stranger on Zoom. You’ll definitely get that “Let’s circle back” response in 6-8 months!

So yeah, if you still don’t have a job in 2025, maybe you’re just not leaning into the manifestation energy enough. Or, maybe you're not following up with a thank you haiku after interviews. Honestly, do you even want it?

I’m a solo recruiter running a small agency/startup in the UK engineering white-collar space – think project managers, QSs, site agents for infrastructure clients. I’ve got 40–50 live roles and it’s just me handling everything.

I’ve got a CRM but it’s honestly not great at tracking things, and the “AI matching” is pretty meh – doesn’t really connect the right CVs with the right jobs.

I’m looking for tools or platforms that actually help me work smarter, especially anything with reaching out/finding more candidates and clients, proper AI to match candidates and jobs, automate outreach, or just help me stay on top of everything without losing my mind.

I’ve heard of Lusha, Carv, Apollo, etc. not sure what’s worth trying in this space.

Would love to hear what other solo or small agency recruiters are using that actually makes a difference.

What’s working for you?

Cheers!

https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1l0iaco/i_built_a_free_aipowered_recruitment_bot_that/,AI in recruiting ,I Built a FREE AI-Powered Recruitment Bot That Finds Perfect Candidates in Minutes (Step-by-Step Guide),"# TL;DR: Created an AI recruitment system that reads job descriptions, extracts keywords automatically, searches LinkedIn for candidates, and organizes everything in Google Sheets. Total cost: $0. Time saved: Hours per hire.

# Why I Built This (The Recruitment Pain)

As someone who's helped with hiring, I was tired of:

* Manually reading job descriptions and guessing search keywords
* Spending hours on LinkedIn looking for the right candidates
* Copy-pasting candidate info into spreadsheets
* Missing qualified people because of poor search terms

**What I wanted:** Upload job description → Get qualified candidates → Organized in spreadsheet

**What I built:** Exactly that, using 100% free tools.

# The Stack (All Free!)

**Tools Used:**

* **N8N** (free workflow automation - like Zapier but better)
* **Google Gemini AI** (free AI for smart analysis)
* **JSearch API** (free job/people search data)
* **Google Sheets** (free spreadsheet automation)

**Total monthly cost:** $0 **Setup time:** 2 hours **Time saved per hire:** 5+ hours

# How It Works (The Magic Flow)

    Job Description → AI Keyword Extraction → LinkedIn Search → Organized Results
    

**Step 1:** Upload any job description  
**Step 2:** AI reads it and extracts key skills, experience, technologies  
**Step 3:** Automatically searches LinkedIn for matching profiles  
**Step 4:** Results appear in organized Google Sheets

**Real example:**

* Input: ""Python developer job description""
* AI extracts: ""Python, AWS, 3+ years, Bachelor's degree""
* Finds: 50+ matching candidates with contact info
* Output: Spreadsheet ready for outreach

# Building It Step-by-Step

# Step 1: Set Up Your Free Accounts

**N8N Account:**

* Go to [n8n.io](http://n8n.io) → Sign up for free
* This gives you visual workflow automation

**Google AI Studio:**

* Visit [aistudio.google.com](http://aistudio.google.com) → Create free API key
* This powers the smart keyword extraction

**RapidAPI Account:**

* Sign up at [rapidapi.com](http://rapidapi.com) → Subscribe to JSearch API (free tier)
* This accesses LinkedIn job/profile data

**Total setup time:** 15 minutes

# Step 2: Build the AI Keyword Extractor

**In N8N, create this workflow:**

1. **Manual Trigger** (starts the process)
2. **HTTP Request to Gemini AI**

**Gemini Configuration:**

    URL: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY
    
    Body: {
      ""contents"": [{
        ""parts"": [{
          ""text"": ""Extract key skills, technologies, job titles, and experience requirements from this job description. Format as comma-separated keywords suitable for LinkedIn search: [JOB DESCRIPTION]""
        }]
      }]
    }
    

**What this does:** AI reads job descriptions and pulls out exactly what you need to search for.

# Step 3: Add LinkedIn Candidate Search

**Add another HTTP Request node:**

*P.S. - If this saves you time in your hiring process, pay it forward and help someone else automate something tedious in their work!*",akhilpanja,n8n,In-favor,AI in Hiring Decisions,"I Built a FREE AI-Powered Recruitment Bot That Finds Perfect Candidates in Minutes (Step-by-Step Guide) # TL;DR: Created an AI recruitment system that reads job descriptions, extracts keywords automatically, searches LinkedIn for candidates, and organizes everything in Google Sheets. Total cost: $0. Time saved: Hours per hire.

# Why I Built This (The Recruitment Pain)

As someone who's helped with hiring, I was tired of:

* Manually reading job descriptions and guessing search keywords
* Spending hours on LinkedIn looking for the right candidates
* Copy-pasting candidate info into spreadsheets
* Missing qualified people because of poor search terms

**What I wanted:** Upload job description → Get qualified candidates → Organized in spreadsheet

**What I built:** Exactly that, using 100% free tools.

# The Stack (All Free!)

**Tools Used:**

* **N8N** (free workflow automation - like Zapier but better)
* **Google Gemini AI** (free AI for smart analysis)
* **JSearch API** (free job/people search data)
* **Google Sheets** (free spreadsheet automation)

**Total monthly cost:** $0 **Setup time:** 2 hours **Time saved per hire:** 5+ hours

# How It Works (The Magic Flow)

    Job Description → AI Keyword Extraction → LinkedIn Search → Organized Results
    

**Step 1:** Upload any job description  
**Step 2:** AI reads it and extracts key skills, experience, technologies  
**Step 3:** Automatically searches LinkedIn for matching profiles  
**Step 4:** Results appear in organized Google Sheets

**Real example:**

* Input: ""Python developer job description""
* AI extracts: ""Python, AWS, 3+ years, Bachelor's degree""
* Finds: 50+ matching candidates with contact info
* Output: Spreadsheet ready for outreach

# Building It Step-by-Step

# Step 1: Set Up Your Free Accounts

**N8N Account:**

* Go to [n8n.io](http://n8n.io) → Sign up for free
* This gives you visual workflow automation

**Google AI Studio:**

* Visit [aistudio.google.com](http://aistudio.google.com) → Create free API key
* This powers the smart keyword extraction

**RapidAPI Account:**

* Sign up at [rapidapi.com](http://rapidapi.com) → Subscribe to JSearch API (free tier)
* This accesses LinkedIn job/profile data

**Total setup time:** 15 minutes

# Step 2: Build the AI Keyword Extractor

**In N8N, create this workflow:**

1. **Manual Trigger** (starts the process)
2. **HTTP Request to Gemini AI**

**Gemini Configuration:**

    URL: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY
    
    Body: {
      ""contents"": [{
        ""parts"": [{
          ""text"": ""Extract key skills, technologies, job titles, and experience requirements from this job description. Format as comma-separated keywords suitable for LinkedIn search: [JOB DESCRIPTION]""
        }]
      }]
    }
    

**What this does:** AI reads job descriptions and pulls out exactly what you need to search for.

# Step 3: Add LinkedIn Candidate Search

**Add another HTTP Request node:**

    URL: https://jsearch.p.rapidapi.com/search?query=software%20engineer%20python&location=united%20states&page=1&num_pages=5
    
    Headers:
    - X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
    - X-RapidAPI-Host: jsearch.p.rapidapi.com
    

**This searches LinkedIn, Indeed, and other platforms simultaneously for candidates matching your AI-extracted keywords.**

# Step 4: Automate Google Sheets Export

**Add Google Sheets node:**

* **Operation:** Append Row
* **Map these fields:**
   * Job Title: `{{ $json.data[0].job_title }}`
   * Company: `{{ $json.data[0].employer_name }}`
   * Skills: `{{ extracted keywords }}`
   * Experience: `{{ $json.data[0].job_description }}`
   * Location: `{{ $json.data[0].job_location }}`
   * Apply Link: `{{ $json.data[0].job_apply_link }}`

❌ **Limited search scope** (only one platform at a time)

# My Automated Solution:

✅ **AI-powered keyword extraction** (never miss relevant skills)  
✅ **Instant results** (seconds vs hours)  
✅ **Consistent quality** (AI doesn't have bad days)  
✅ **Organized output** (professional spreadsheets)  
✅ **Multi-platform search** (LinkedIn + Indeed + others)

# Advanced Features You Can Add

# Multi-Country Search

    locations = [""united states"", ""canada"", ""united kingdom"", ""germany""]
    

# Skill-Based Filtering

    required_skills = ["""", ""AWS"", ""Docker""]
    nice_to_have = [""React"", ""Kubernetes""]
    

# Experience Level Targeting

# Pro Tips for Maximum Results

# 1. Write Better  Descriptions

The AI is only as good as your input. Include:

* Specific technologies (not just ""programming"")
* Clear experience requirements
* Must-have vs nice-to-have skills

# 2. Use Geographic Targeting

    Remote candidates: location=""remote""
    Local candidates: location=""san francisco"" 
    Global search: location=""worldwide""
    

# 3. A/B Test Your Keywords

Run the same  description through different AI prompts to see which finds better candidates.

# 4. Set Up Alerts

Use 's scheduling to run searches daily and email you new candidates.

# Try It Yourself

**This weekend project:**

1. Set up the free accounts (30 minutes)
2. Build the basic  (1 hour)
3. Test with a real  description (30 minutes)
4. Watch qualified candidates appear automatically

**Then scale it:**

* Add more search sources
* Implement candidate scoring
* Create automated outreach sequences
* Build your recruiting empire

# The Future of Recruiting

**This is just the beginning.** AI-powered recruiting tools will become standard because:

* **AI gets better at understanding  requirements**
* **More platforms open APIs for candidate data**
* **Automation tools become more powerful**
* **Companies realize the competitive advantage**

**Early adopters win.** While others manually search LinkedIn, you'll have an AI assistant finding perfect candidates 24/7.

# Final Thoughts

**Six months ago, building this would have required:**

* A development team
* Expensive enterprise software
* Months of integration work
* Thousands in monthly costs

**Today, you can build it in a weekend for free.**

The tools are democratized. The APIs exist. The AI is accessible.

**The only question is: Will you build it before your competition does?**

I started a recruitment agency, and this program has been a life changer! And AI isn't killing any of us!","I started a recruitment agency, and this program has been a life changer!

So I and my other friend started a recruitment agency a few months ago. We only work in the architectural and construction industry and our primary market is the Middle East (for obvious reasons.)

We didn’t get even one client when we were manually outreaching because the job ads on LinkedIn or elsewhere that are posted by the companies that are looking for engineers/architects, by the time we reach out to them, they’re already interviewing someone.

I mean, the whole system was a mess!

My partner, after some research found a tool like [SignalsAPI](http://signalsapi.com/?via=am). I’m actually blown away by this tool!

As soon as a company drops a job, it picks up the “signal” and lets us know, and since we set this up in a way that once a job has been posted, the right person should be emailed, it just shoots the email.

I mean, this thing is so good, and this program also has so many other features, which, of course we haven’t tried yet.

This made me ponder and realize, I think AI isn’t going to kill all of us like we presume it would do. As long as we were out and running, our businesses should thrive.

Now I’m doing at least three meetings per day with prospects from 0. Just because I and my partner were really serious about this, we’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

In 2025, all you have to do is pick yourself up and run! You have tools for everything. Someone must’ve already built it or must be building it.

Just get up first and start! The rest will fall in place!

The problem is that we've consistently had hiring related issues, and basically all hires since I've  have ended up being bombs to the point where we've had to hire foreign contractors to fill positions. This has been over 5+ years of me working at my current company.

With the amount of  complaining that they cannot find jobs, especially new grads, why are we having such challenges finding hires? We provide a competitive base salary (near the bottom of our region's range but still competitive), benefits (standard benefits package) and competitive TC which is driven entirely by RSUs. On top of this we are 100% Remote with anything in office being handled by 5  who live local (includes myself). We are posting to LinkedIn and have a strong LinkedIn presence. The  postings are posted by our company and not the hiring agency. The listing passes my filter for ""I'd apply for this"".

The only thing I can think of is that we are not ""Big Tech"". I work at a small company (<50 employees). Is this hurting access to the  pool? Are our recruiters being too restrictive in filtering? Are AI-driven  stealing spots non-AI driven  would be normally populating?

That’s why I usually skip job boards and apply directly on company sites. But before I started using ChatGPT, I tried several things like applying on Quick Apply on LinkedIn, or fake jobs on Indeed. I even tried using tools like RSS feed to collect jobs for me—it didn’t work well at all because every site is different, many don’t even have RSS feeds. To be honest this whole process was a mess.

Then I discovered ChatGPT after looking at similar experiences of others on Reddit and their ideas, and it changed everything. I couldn’t believe how much easier it made things. I read about how GPT works and how does it process stuff, a lot is available online.

Then I decided to spend a few weeks putting together a list of around 25,000 companies that are hiring right now. Using ChatGPT’s API and other website’s API, I was able to automatically gather job listings and even create summaries of the job descriptions.

After a lot of trial and error, I finally built something that works. And the best part I made it free for anyone to use: Skillsire

Fun fact: ChatGPT processes information super-fast! It can handle around 175 billion parameters (numbers that help it make decisions) and can give answers in seconds.

Best part about this tool

You can filter according to Title and even skills.

You can add year of experience, even specify any range.

You can search for internship, early career, full-time, contract roles all at one place.

Want remote jobs, we have filter for that also.

Now that this tool is so amazing, I started working with another person and we have started working on some groundbreaking filters. We started working on “Visa Sponsorship” filter which provides jobs which sponsors visa. We are still trying to fine tune as GPT doesn’t guarantee 100% correctness.

However other amazing filters are in work that is going to blow everyone’s mind.

I’m just a 30 year-old college dropout, looking for a second job at a fast-food joint, warehouse, or convenience store, so he can finally move out of his retired parents’ house and start his own life. The problem is that it’s so bloody difficult to even set up an interview with an actual human. I’ve applied to dozens of job postings on Indeed.com, only to be ignored for weeks, rejected for reasons I was left in the dark about, or falsely promised an in-person interview by a chatbot on a company website. You don’t know how infuriating it is to finally schedule an interview online after months of despairing in my unemployment, show up at some obscure warehouse in the middle of nowhere and realize that nobody was expecting me, and then march back home, utterly defeated. This happened twice before, at two humble fast food joints that aren’t even sophisticated enough to require an automated hiring process that they don’t even use. I only got my current job at ShopRite by calling an actual person, and that was weeks after I applied online. At this point, my only hope is barging into my local McDonalds or KFC and begging for a job, because I can’t trust their chatbots as far as I could throw them.

EDIT:

Okay, maybe the real enemy here is excessive automation, rather than chat-GPT. I understand that hiring managers get hundreds of candidates applying for jobs that they aren’t even remotely qualified for, so they have to set up systems that automatically filter out certain resumes, just to make the sifting process easier.

The system asked me 5 questions and I had a minute to read each one and ready myself mentally before answering in 3 minutes or less. The system does not allow you to delete your recording and make additional attempts.

Exploring what organizations should know about using AI in Recruitment & Talent Acquisition efforts 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business is increasingly becoming a focal point as organizations strive to enhance and streamline their workforce operations. As we delve into the realms of AI, it’s crucial to address a common gap in understanding what AI truly encompasses. This blog seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding AI, distinguishing between concepts like process automation and predictive analytics and generative AI, such as ChatGPT. As we explore the nuances of AI applications, including the emergent field of Prompt Engineering and the intricacies of AI training, we’ll also scrutinize the ethical and legal ramifications of AI-generated content and data usage. By dissecting these multifaceted issues, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of AI’s role in business and its broader implications.

AI in business is a growing trend, especially as many organizations look to optimize and augment their workforce. However, I think it’s important to mention that many organizations do not understand what AI is. The term has been thrown around to include process automation, predictive/advanced analytics, and generative AI (ChatGPT). These misunderstandings often conflate the topic; for example, within generative AI, many people confuse training with AI chat prompt manipulation. Prompt manipulation is absolutely something useful in leveraging AI, hence the emergence of the “Prompt Engineering” job. However, training is where many advancements are happening. It’s also important to know where data comes from, who owns it, and how it is being used in training. It is extremely important to the resulting impacts of how we work with AI and how organizations leverage it. For example, when Amazon tried to create an AI recruiting tool, it resulted in unintentional bias. Most likely propagated by implicit bias in their training data and model-building methods. Another issue is ownership not only of the data but also of the content being generated According to Lexology , “the Copyright Office guidance indicates AI-generated content may be copyright protected if the work is in some way original and unique.” But is content based on scraped and acquired data original? Also, what if that generated content comes from an AI model that is scraping data illegally? There are dozens of lawsuits going after large technology companies scraping AI model training data International Association of Privacy Professionals.

These topics, and others, extend to how we look at utilizing AI in the Talent space. A recent post on the Reddit forum I moderated on r/humanresources was a call for advice on catching people using ChatGPT / Generative AI on their resumes. Surprisingly, the mass opinion was that no one cared if people used a tool (ChatGPT) to create their content; they viewed it no differently than hiring a writer or career coach. However, the problem stemmed from wrongfully representing themselves. Therein lies the danger: when you have something like AI creating content, with little visibility into how it is making the content and problems such as Hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results) from AI, you open yourself or your company up to liability or poor results. Just look at NYC’s AI chatbot telling business’ to do illegal things. Similar problems in the talent world exist, such as benefits chatbots generating incorrect results for employees (or incoming candidates), which can open the company up to liability. I recommend that companies utilize strict RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to limit hallucinations and ground AI text generation by providing context. However, I still believe organizations should use these AI techniques to augment rather than replace HR & recruitment professionals.

Lastly, I see many more companies interested in measuring employee & candidate experience trends, which are important people metrics as they relate to employee performance, engagement, satisfaction, and retention, and turnover. These are topics that many companies, such as Deloitte, have recognized as growing HR trends . Candidate experience is important as it relates to the likelihood of hiring qualified candidates, and it is related to the outcomes of that candidate as an employee. Furthermore, candidate experience impacts employer branding as well as consumer decisions. Simply put, if your company provides a poor candidate experience by hiring low-quality recruiters (or outsourced recruiters), having a poor interview process, or having marketplace misaligned jobs, you are hurting your company in a variety of ways. When talking about AI from a candidate experience perspective, the saying, “People join people, and people hire people,” comes to mind. Adding in-personal technology, such as an AI chatbot, removes that people element and retracts from the candidate’s experience.

In conclusion, the integration of AI in business, especially in the talent and HR sectors, poses both opportunities and challenges. As companies increasingly leverage AI to enhance candidate and employee experiences, it’s imperative to balance technological advancements with ethical considerations and human touch. While AI can significantly augment HR functions, it should not replace the nuanced judgment and empathy that human professionals bring to the table. Ensuring responsible use of AI, addressing potential biases, and maintaining transparency will be crucial in harnessing AI’s full potential while safeguarding against its pitfalls. Ultimately, fostering a holistic approach that values both technology and human interaction will be key to achieving sustainable success in the evolving landscape of AI in business.

Using my own LLM model running a Mistral model I created a TLDR (though its not that short lol)

TL;DR: AI in business, particularly in recruitment and talent acquisition, is growing in importance but is often misunderstood, conflating different aspects like process automation, analytics, and generative AI. Ethical and legal issues, such as data ownership and bias, are significant concerns, as demonstrated by Amazon's biased AI recruiting tool. The emergence of ""Prompt Engineering"" highlights the importance of understanding AI's capabilities and limitations. While AI can enhance HR functions, it shouldn't replace human judgment. Responsible AI use, addressing biases, and maintaining human interaction are essential for leveraging AI's benefits while avoiding its pitfalls in the talent and HR sectors",RexRecruiting,recruiting,Neutral,AI in Hiring Decisions,"AI in Recruitment & Talent Acquisition I finished my IO Psychology MS and finally have some time to contribute more to the community and AreWeHiring.com.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business is increasingly becoming a focal point as organizations strive to enhance and streamline their workforce operations. As we delve into the realms of AI, it’s crucial to address a common gap in understanding what AI truly encompasses. This blog seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding AI, distinguishing between concepts like process automation and predictive analytics and generative AI, such as ChatGPT. As we explore the nuances of AI applications, including the emergent field of Prompt Engineering and the intricacies of AI training, we’ll also scrutinize the ethical and legal ramifications of AI-generated content and data usage. By dissecting these multifaceted issues, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of AI’s role in business and its broader implications.

AI in business is a growing trend, especially as many organizations look to optimize and augment their workforce. However, I think it’s important to mention that many organizations do not understand what AI is. The term has been thrown around to include process automation, predictive/advanced analytics, and generative AI (ChatGPT). These misunderstandings often conflate the topic; for example, within generative AI, many people confuse training with AI chat prompt manipulation. Prompt manipulation is absolutely something useful in leveraging AI, hence the emergence of the “Prompt Engineering” job. However, training is where many advancements are happening. It’s also important to know where data comes from, who owns it, and how it is being used in training. It is extremely important to the resulting impacts of how we work with AI and how organizations leverage it. For example, when Amazon tried to create an AI recruiting tool, it resulted in unintentional bias. Most likely propagated by implicit bias in their training data and model-building methods. Another issue is ownership not only of the data but also of the content being generated According to Lexology , “the Copyright Office guidance indicates AI-generated content may be copyright protected if the work is in some way original and unique.” But is content based on scraped and acquired data original? Also, what if that generated content comes from an AI model that is scraping data illegally? There are dozens of lawsuits going after large technology companies scraping AI model training data International Association of Privacy Professionals.

These topics, and others, extend to how we look at utilizing AI in the Talent space. A recent post on the Reddit forum I moderated on r/humanresources was a call for advice on catching people using ChatGPT / Generative AI on their resumes. Surprisingly, the mass opinion was that no one cared if people used a tool (ChatGPT) to create their content; they viewed it no differently than hiring a writer or career coach. However, the problem stemmed from wrongfully representing themselves. Therein lies the danger: when you have something like AI creating content, with little visibility into how it is making the content and problems such as Hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results) from AI, you open yourself or your company up to liability or poor results. Just look at NYC’s AI chatbot telling business’ to do illegal things. Similar problems in the talent world exist, such as benefits chatbots generating incorrect results for employees (or incoming candidates), which can open the company up to liability. I recommend that companies utilize strict RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to limit hallucinations and ground AI text generation by providing context. However, I still believe organizations should use these AI techniques to augment rather than replace HR & recruitment professionals.

Lastly, I see many more companies interested in measuring employee & candidate experience trends, which are important people metrics as they relate to employee performance, engagement, satisfaction, and retention, and turnover. These are topics that many companies, such as Deloitte, have recognized as growing HR trends . Candidate experience is important as it relates to the likelihood of hiring qualified candidates, and it is related to the outcomes of that candidate as an employee. Furthermore, candidate experience impacts employer branding as well as consumer decisions. Simply put, if your company provides a poor candidate experience by hiring low-quality recruiters (or outsourced recruiters), having a poor interview process, or having marketplace misaligned jobs, you are hurting your company in a variety of ways. When talking about AI from a candidate experience perspective, the saying, “People join people, and people hire people,” comes to mind. Adding in-personal technology, such as an AI chatbot, removes that people element and retracts from the candidate’s experience.

In conclusion, the integration of AI in business, especially in the talent and HR sectors, poses both opportunities and challenges. As companies increasingly leverage AI to enhance candidate and employee experiences, it’s imperative to balance technological advancements with ethical considerations and human touch. While AI can significantly augment HR functions, it should not replace the nuanced judgment and empathy that human professionals bring to the table. Ensuring responsible use of AI, addressing potential biases, and maintaining transparency will be crucial in harnessing AI’s full potential while safeguarding against its pitfalls. Ultimately, fostering a holistic approach that values both technology and human interaction will be key to achieving sustainable success in the evolving landscape of AI in business.

Using my own LLM model running a Mistral model I created a TLDR (though its not that short lol)

TL;DR: AI in business, particularly in recruitment and talent acquisition, is growing in importance but is often misunderstood, conflating different aspects like process automation, analytics, and generative AI.

The emergence of ""Prompt Engineering"" highlights the importance of understanding AI's capabilities and limitations. While AI can enhance HR functions, it shouldn't replace human judgment.

And yeah morals should come into it. We shouldn't just assume that the way things currently are is the best way, I think if there is a way for society to be improved for everyone then we should aim for that.

Neither party has been good for social mobility.

[Because the average person is an idiot. People believe what they read/see on social media. The   parties are very good at divide and conquer. It’s easy to blame  or someone who claims Universal Credit as the problem.  We should be taxed on assets, not income. But it will never happen.

>Why tax what has already been taxed? You seem to regard yourself as 'above average', so perhaps you could explain your reasoning to us idiots.
>>Because it stops wealth concentrating.  Which it has a habit of doing.  Money sitting in some trust fund is not productive for society.  Or did you miss the last few decades where wealth inequality has only increased?
>>>This assumes that any private wealth has to be productive for society and the standard of what 'productive' means is different for everyone. Wealth doesn't have to serve the collective and it shouldn't be redistributed under that idea.
>>>>If we aren't trying to make the world a better place than where we started what's the point of any of this.  The world is worth more than adding 0s to a bank balance
>>>>>This makes it sounds like more of a moral argument than an  argument. I agree we should make the world a better place, but I don't agree that we achieve that by taking other people's money and using it according to someone else's ideals. Is that really just?
>>>>>>It's more just than it becoming a dragons hoard.  And it would have value just beyond that initial inflow it would move money around which is good for the economy.  And yeah morals should come into it. We shouldn't just assume that the way things currently are is the best way, I think if there is a way for society to be improved for everyone then we should aim for that.  And I'm not advocating just taking people's money, I'd probably increase inheritance tax, luxury goods taxes and land value taxes

You are precisely the sort of person I was mocking in my first post.

>One of them sends money to deprived areas, the other takes that money and sends it to well off leafy areas and boasts about doing so at the hustings.
>>This sounds nice on the surface but that’s not necessarily helping people escape poverty. Eg until 2 child benefit cap some people would pop babies out as means of income. This sends money to deprived areas yet also keeps people poor.  I don’t think politics is a simple as “take money away from evil  and give it to virtuous poor”. Neither party has been good for social mobility. I’d rather see them encourage eg part time work to help young parents find work, invest in supply of more childcare facilities (as giving more childcare vouchers whilst supply is the same just inflates the prices), pipe down on the green air zones (as guess who gets hit the hardest?

The narrative that America (or as some agitators like to call, the ""aMeRiCaN EmPiRe"") is ""collapsing"" or ""dying"" has been floating around for a few years now, mostly in polarized social media spaces detached from reality, and mostly in response to the rise of Trump, the greater conservative populist movement, and political polarity. At first, I just found it annoying because doom and gloom help no one who isn't trying to gain from that message, and hope is always a better avenue. But I have now come to the belief that the idea isn't just annoying, it's historically blatantly untrue and will remain untrue. I've had this thought for a little while now, but I'm finally writing this because of what we are seeing in Los Angeles, so here goes.

My reasoning stems from the idea that this country has made it through *WAY* worse than anything we've seen in the last decade. The saying may be cliche, but I genuinely stand by it when viewing history, both domestically and abroad. America signed the Dec. of Independence in 1776, and was able to begin operating as its own country after the revolutionary war in 1783, so I'm going to be viewing from that year on afterwards.

**I'll begin by looking domestically**. These are the 3 biggest events in my opinion that our nation went through which genuinely had true and full potential to end the country as people knew it:

1. The War of 1812. The British Empire trying to regain what they had lost is genuinely horrifying if you think about it. Imagine gaining independence only to have to fight off the very same oppressive totalitarian aggressor *again* just to keep it. That doesn't usually happen in history, where instead one of 3 things normally happen: conquered territory is never relinquished and forever altered, territory is never conquered, or territory is conquered, but then freed from that specific aggressor forever. We had to engage the very same aggressor, as if Britain could not fathom the idea that it did not have a right to our nation. I feel like the War of 1812 isn't talked about enough because it's the only war since our Revolution where America, as a whole, had to fight another nation not for its benefit or revenge, but for its total survival. But we did it and made it through.
2. Confederacy and Civil War. Self explanatory; country actually did split and resulted in the deadliest war in American history by American casualties because it was Americans fighting Americans. Civil wars normally end in either one side's victory, or permanent fraction. We came out with the former and moved on.
3. Great Depression. America had become one with its industry and industry economy at this point, so what the Great Depression had the potential to do was basically never let us come back. But we came back and moved on (love you FDR).

Before I continue, there were two other events I considered but decided against, and I want to address:

* Chattel slavery. It was horrific and the poster child of the humans rights abuses this country was physically founded upon (in conjunction with native genocide), and we must continue to learn from history. However, for this post, I must look at numbers: since 1783, African Americans, slaves or free,  were never majority of the people in the nation's entirety (not talking about specific states where they actually were at some points). At its peak in 1860, slavery accounted for 4M people, with the total population being around 31.5M. Today, AA's make up 13% of the population. In my opinion, while slavery anywhere is a great argument for QOL and human/civil rights measures, you can't determine the future health/continuation of a nation based on the ill of a genuine numerical minority.
* COVID. Obviously a terrible disaster and may all those affected find health and peace. But when viewing numbers, it took a greater toll on well being and emotional health than it did actual stability. Numbers wise, population was barely scratched (around 1.2M out of around 330M). And while the economy clearly tanked and we will be facing countless problems (mostly mental) in the future because of COVID, we came out pretty well given this was the modern day plague and the world began by having 0 counter. The lockdowns sucked and in 1929, they might have ended us. But this time we had technology and it was honestly that which saved our economy from total collapse like what happened in the GD, and also the reason why despite the economy tanking overall, unlike the GD, there were economic increases in many distinct places too (ex: Zoom).

Since the GD, almost everything America has been involved with regarding our health as a nation has been domestic civil political unrest and conflicts abroad, so ones not on American soil, and thus not ones that really threatened the nation's people's lives and thus the nation's continuation. Cold War was terrifying yes, but it didn't amount to shit. Worst artificial attacks against explicitly American life since the civil war (I count COVID as a disease that the whole world had to fight) were Pearl Harbor and 9/11, and while tragic, made us stronger pretty much immediately.

So with the 3 major domestic events above, plus all the major abroad ones and all the littler events in mind, where are we now? A nation around 250 years old (so a a fetus) that has, ballpark, 80%+ of the same civil rights (free speech, worker's rights, women's and racial minority vote and participation, LGBTQ marriage, free practice of religion, etc) as developed and socially progressed nations thousands and thousands of years older than us, enshrined into our law. Practice can be argued to be a different story, and there's always room to improve in every nation, but the recognition of the rights on paper in federal law is what is most important and marks how people will be viewed by the government from there on out; as African Americans were known to say, ""freedom comes first."" And America has been the world leader in military might, economy, technology, and volume of higher education for quite a while now. If we weathered all of that first sentence, and still come out to this degree of historical progress in comparison to other nations, and at the stupidly young age we're at, I find it very hard to believe we're just ""done for"" because of one guy in 8 broken up years. Until we hit events that have the danger scale of the 3 I mentioned (no, social media echo chambers fear mongering about a civil war don't count), I believe our history shows we will be fine.

So now to address fears of Trump's government, its perceived erosion of democracy and stability, and any fears of future all out authoritarianism. I may dislike throwing terms like ""fascism"" around. But I do not like Trump (for a plethora of reasons) and think that some of his ideas, at their worst, are directly un-American, and thus I want to validate peoples concerns and address them. I'm going begin by looking globally, then swing back domestically again:

1. I'll begin with *the* example of fascism, Germany. And actually, this doesn't need much explanation. The time gap between Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s and modern day Germany in 2025 is basically a second historically, not even 100 years. Germany didn't just have fears of fascism, they slid directly into it and became *the* case example studied everywhere. Look at where they're at now. Those same major cities, Berlin, Frankfurt, etc are still there. Borders of core German area are still in tact and pretty much as they were prior Austria's annexation. Population increased. And economy and industry, while only revived because of help at first, is now one of the best in the world. So we know for a definitive fact beyond all fear mongering, reasonable doubt, and hopelessness that even when the worst actually literally does come to worst, a nation can come back, prevail, and exist and thrive in the future. No American in the last 100 years has lived under a government that came even close to what Hitler's became. Next.
2. China. Again, it's a pretty open and shut argument. What Mao did to his population in numbers makes anything that Hitler, Leopold, and Stalin did, numbers wise, look elementary. The consensus estimate is 15-55M of deaths, with the number 40M being used quite a bit. In other words, too many to actually count. And yet this happened in 1950-60s, and we're in 2025, so an even *shorter* time gap than Germany. Where is China now? Well, this writing is about continued survival of nations, which is dependent on stability and human life. It's not about non-lethal civil rights abuses. I may despise the Chinese government, but in modern day, there are two nations who objectively lead the world in military might and industry. China is one of them. Given what Mao did not even 80 years earlier, that's impressive.

Returning domestically, I'll look at political unrest since the Civil War, beginning with riots. I'll be bias very quickly: the current LA protests are just. But the LA riots are pretty scary. That latter view is shared by pretty much everyone, ranging from ""hey we can protest the ICE raids peacefully without vandalism or waving the Mexican flag"" all the way to flat out racism. We all hate seeing what's happening.

But what I find almost ridiculous is that these riots in the last 5 years, whether they be for Floyd or Gaza or immigrants, are somehow being used to say ""yeah we're done."" The summer of 2020 was bad (Minnesotan here, saw it myself). But I don't think anything has happened in the 21st century on American soil with regards to civil unrest that is on par with what we saw in the 20th century; Rodney King, Red Summer, Vietnam demo.'s, Black Panther party, and peaceful MLK demonstrations are all examples off the top of my head. And yet here we are; America is not going to die because of civil unrest lol.

Next, fears of ""life is gonna be shit because \[\*insert political group I disagree with\*\] is in power."" Life is tough lol ofc. But as America keeps progressing at an unparalleled rate compared to the ages of other countries, I think there's a pretty simple reason that riots and civil unrest are becoming less intense and frequent (e.g. 21st vs 20th century): despite any narrative, shit has actually improved for everyone. Yes, as has been the case since America's founding, white people have dominantly reaped the greatest and most improvements in QOL because: a) numbers, as they've always been the largest racial demographic and b) first direct, then systemic racism. But QOL is measured as an average of all, and we do not live in an apartheid state like 20th century South Africa or India, so any improvements in QOL are felt by all, whether it be civil rights, tech, medicine (like vaccines), etc, just in varying quantities. If you ask most racial minorities in this country if they've encountered racism, experienced hardships, or feel like they have ever been treated unfairly, I think most will understandably answer yes. But if you ask those same people (especially the largest two minority demographics, African and Hispanic Americans) whether they genuinely want to leave America or be ""rescued,"" most will answer no, and that isn't just because of ""mUh FrEeDoM."" And ignoring race, we can look at general political sentiment too. Right now, Red is in power, so majority Blue states don't love it; que the vice versa and same pattern happening for every administration since at least the 20th century and in the future. But even in r/LosAngeles right now, you have people in the same comment section slandering ICE *an*d downvoting comments that promote Cali ceding from the US. This is not the first time political tensions have been high asf post-civil war, and will not be the last. But none of this has ever been enough to truly end us, or have the majority of people to say ""yeah screw the united country.""

Last, I will look at the relationship of the American government and political stability:

1. Starting with an easy one, SCOTUS. Any attempt to use SCOTUS's perceived political leaning as reason for ""welp there goes democracy"" is ignorant and historically blind imo. SCOTUS has *always* ocellated in political ideology since its inception. It has made many terrible judgements. It is also the reason why we have gay marriage, desegregated schools, and worker's rights. Again, the question remains the same: since SCOTUS's inception, where are we now? I'd argue we are way better off now than where we were before the first court presided. The idea that SCOTUS needs to be ""packed"" to save its integrity because some people don't like the current court's perceived political leaning is both inconsistent and absurd. SCOTUS is not a good indicator of collapse.
   * I can give you a good example with the current court: perceived conservative majority, 6/9 justices being picks by current party (3/9 by current president here too) in power. And yet, since current presidential term began, it is the judicial branch led by SCOTUS that has halted Trump the most, and this has included SCOTUS directly. This court has both granted Trump wins, *and* handed unanimous losses; ACB, Trump's latest pick, just shredded his own lawyer two weeks ago. SCOTUS will most likely always be SCOTUS.
2. *This is not the first time* America has had a ""wtf"" administration, or one perceived to be terrible for the people. A few of them happened leading up to the Civil War, and then ones that failed reconstruction. Then there was Hoover to whom the entire population said ""nah this is ass what's the other option."" But then there's also, among others, Nixon, whose was well into the 20th century. And he fucked up enough to where he was actually gonna be the first ever to be removed from office if he didn't high tail it out of there. We were fine after those presidents, we will be fine after this one.

Finally, and I may get hate for this, but 2A. 2A wasn't put in the constitution for no reason. I highly doubt right now that we will ever see its implied overarching purpose utilized, but who knows. Regardless, while never seen before, the same amendment that grants America a unique problem (gun violence) is the very reason that, beyond our military, we are nearly impossible to invade by eternal nations, or be tyrannized by our own. No civil population has ever in the history of the world been as armed as the American one is. It's also one of many things where party doesn't matter, as guns are owned across the board. There is no world in which the military will want to engage with the genuine American population (we're not talking riots here lol, barely anyone attends those). Technologically we'd get creamed sure, but that's only possible with mass casualties; bombs primarily. And you will be hard pressed to find anyone in the military who will actually follow a ""bomb your fellow civilian on your own soil"" order. So that leaves direct gunfire combat, which is dangerous for everyone involved, and law enforcement and military know this. And none of this considers fractions in the military and law enforcement.

I wrote this to argue that America as a nation will not collapse, and the notion it will is foolish. But just because the general health and survival of a nation remains intact doesn't mean individual losses don't happen and won't happen in the instantaneous, and I want to acknowledge that. Optimism in future stability doesn't invalidate someone's individual hardship. Like every nation, America has a terrible history both domestically and abroad. And just because it has survived, progressed, and thrived with a majority of its population, doesn't mean there weren't many many unjust losses that didn't happen but didn't collapse the US. Example: Jim Crow and COVID are good examples, with America prevailing but the respective losses to African Americans and COVID victims still happening. I think it's also important to acknowledge the difference between loss of modern civil luxury and convenience, and life and stability; and that while the losing the former sucks, it doesn't indicate collapse and is not the same as losing the latter. Like how immigrants from war torn countries don't move because they can't get an abortion, they move because there is no country. Or how, despite their civil freedoms being in the toilet, China isn't going to collapse because their government rigged an election. Best thing we can do imo is to keep our heads up and faith in each other, look at history, see where people have gotten and progressed to in the long run despite challenges, and go from there.

And yet, since current presidential term began, it is the judicial branch led by SCOTUS that has halted Trump the most, and this has included SCOTUS directly. This court has both granted Trump wins, *and* handed unanimous losses; ACB, Trump's latest pick, just shredded his own lawyer two weeks ago. SCOTUS will most likely always be SCOTUS.
2. *This is not the first time* America has had a ""wtf"" administration, or one perceived to be terrible for the people. A few of them happened leading up to the Civil War, and then ones that failed reconstruction. Then there was Hoover to whom the entire population said ""nah this is ass what's the other option."" But then there's also, among others, Nixon, whose was well into the 20th century. And he fucked up enough to where he was actually gonna be the first ever to be removed from office if he didn't high tail it out of there. We were fine after those presidents, we will be fine after this one.

Finally, and I may get hate for this, but 2A. 2A wasn't put in the constitution for no reason. I highly doubt right now that we will ever see its implied overarching purpose utilized, but who knows. Regardless, while never seen before, the same amendment that grants America a unique problem (gun violence) is the very reason that, beyond our military, we are nearly impossible to invade by eternal nations, or be tyrannized by our own. No civil population has ever in the history of the world been as armed as the American one is. It's also one of many things where party doesn't matter, as guns are owned across the board. There is no world in which the military will want to engage with the genuine American population (we're not talking riots here lol, barely anyone attends those). Technologically we'd get creamed sure, but that's only possible with mass casualties; bombs primarily. And you will be hard pressed to find anyone in the military who will actually follow a ""bomb your fellow civilian on your own soil"" order. So that leaves direct gunfire combat, which is dangerous for everyone involved, and law enforcement and military know this. And none of this considers fractions in the military and law enforcement.

I wrote this to argue that America as a nation will not collapse, and the notion it will is foolish. But just because the general health and survival of a nation remains intact doesn't mean individual losses don't happen and won't happen in the instantaneous, and I want to acknowledge that. Optimism in future stability doesn't invalidate someone's individual hardship. Like every nation, America has a terrible history both domestically and abroad. And just because it has survived, progressed, and thrived with a majority of its population, doesn't mean there weren't many many unjust losses that didn't happen but didn't collapse the US. Example: Jim Crow and COVID are good examples, with America prevailing but the respective losses to African Americans and COVID victims still happening. I think it's also important to acknowledge the difference between loss of modern civil luxury and convenience, and life and stability; and that while the losing the former sucks, it doesn't indicate collapse and is not the same as losing the latter. Like how immigrants from war torn countries don't move because they can't get an abortion, they move because there is no country. Or how, despite their civil freedoms being in the toilet, China isn't going to collapse because their government rigged an election. Best thing we can do imo is to keep our heads up and faith in each other, look at history, see where people have gotten and progressed to in the long run despite challenges, and go from there. Cheers","opinion ( long ) : given the history of internal and external examples , the usa will not and will be absolutely * * tldr ; we 're lol * * the narrative that america ( or as some agitators to call , the `` american empire '' ) is `` collapsing '' or `` '' has been floating around for a few years now , mostly in polarized social media spaces detached from reality , and mostly in response to the rise of , the greater populist movement , and political polarity . at first , i just found it because and help no one who is n't trying to from that message , and hope is always a avenue . but i have now come to the belief that the idea is n't just , it 's historically and will remain . i 've had this thought for a little while now , but i 'm finally writing this because of what we are seeing in los angeles , so here goes . my reasoning stems from the idea that this country has made it through * way * than anything we 've seen in the last decade . the saying may be , but i genuinely stand by it when viewing history , both domestically and abroad . america signed the dec. of independence in 1776 , and was able to begin operating as its own country after the war in 1783 , so i 'm going to be viewing from that year on afterwards . * * i 'll begin by looking domestically * * . these are the 3 biggest events in my opinion that our nation went through which genuinely had true and full potential to end the country as people knew it : 1. the war of 1812. the british empire trying to regain what they had is genuinely if you think about it . imagine independence only to have to fight off the very same * again * just to keep it . that does n't usually happen in history , where instead one of 3 things normally happen : conquered territory is never relinquished and forever altered , territory is never conquered , or territory is conquered , but then from that specific forever . we had to engage the very same , as if britain could not fathom the idea that it did not have a to our nation . i feel the war of 1812 is n't talked about because it 's the only war since our revolution where america , as a whole , had to fight another nation not for its or , but for its total . but we did it and made it through . 2. confederacy and civil war . self explanatory ;

as african americans were known to say , `` comes first . '' and america has been the world leader in military might , economy , technology , and volume of higher education for quite a while now . if we weathered all of that first sentence , and still come out to this degree of historical in comparison to other nations , and at the young age we 're at , i find it very to believe we 're just `` done for '' because of one guy in 8 up years . until we hit events that have the scale of the 3 i mentioned ( no , social media echo chambers mongering about a civil war do n't count ) , i believe our history shows we will be . so now to address of 's government , its perceived of democracy and , and any of future all out authoritarianism . i may throwing terms `` '' around . but i do not ( for a plethora of reasons ) and think that some of his ideas , at their , are directly un-american , and thus i want to validate peoples and address them . i 'm going begin by looking globally , then swing back domestically again : 1. i 'll begin with * the * example of , germany . and actually , this does n't need much explanation . the time gap between hitler 's rise to power in the 1930s and day germany in 2025 is basically a second historically , not even 100 years . germany did n't just have of , they slid directly into it and became * the * case example studied everywhere . look at where they 're at now . those same major cities , berlin , frankfurt , etc are still there . borders of core german area are still in tact and much as they were prior austria 's annexation . population increased . and economy and industry , while only revived because of help at first , is now one of the in the world . so we know for a definitive fact beyond all mongering , , and that even when the actually literally does come to , a nation can come back , prevail , and exist and in the future . no american in the last 100 years has lived under a government that came even close to what hitler 's became . next . 2. china . again , it 's a open and shut argument . what mao did to his population in numbers makes anything that hitler , leopold , and stalin did , numbers , look elementary . the consensus estimate is 15-55m of deaths , with the number 40m being used quite a bit . in other words , too many to actually count . and yet this happened in 1950-60s , and we 're in 2025 , so an even * shorter * time gap than germany . where is china now ? , this writing is about continued of nations , which is dependent on and human life . it 's not about non-lethal civil rights . i may the chinese government , but in day , there are two nations who objectively the world in military might and industry . china is one of them . given what mao did not even 80 years earlier , that 's . returning domestically , i 'll look at political since the civil war , beginning with riots . i 'll be very quickly : the current la are just . but the la riots are . that latter view is shared by much everyone , ranging from `` hey we can the ice raids without vandalism or waving the mexican flag '' all the way to flat out . we all seeing what 's happening . but what i find almost is that these riots in the last 5 years , whether they be for floyd or gaza or immigrants , are somehow being used to say `` yeah we 're done . '' the summer of 2020 was ( minnesotan here , saw it myself ) . but i do n't think anything has happened in the 21st century on american soil with regards to civil that is on par with what we saw in the 20th century ; rodney king , red summer , vietnam demo . 's , black panther party , and mlk demonstrations are all examples off the of my head . and yet here we are ; america is not going to because of civil lol . next , of `` life is gon na be because \ [ \ * insert political group i with\ * \ ] is in power . '' life is lol ofc . but as america keeps progressing at an rate compared to the ages of other countries , i think there 's a simple reason that riots and civil are becoming less and frequent ( e.g . 21st vs 20th century ) : despite any narrative , has actually for everyone . yes , as has been the case since america 's founding , white people have dominantly reaped the and most in qol because : a ) numbers , as they 've always been the largest racial demographic and b ) first direct , then systemic . but qol is measured as an average of all , and we do not live in an apartheid state 20th century south africa or india , so any in qol are felt by all , whether it be civil rights , tech , medicine ( vaccines ) , etc , just in varying quantities . if you ask most racial minorities in this country if they 've encountered , experienced , or feel they have ever been treated , i think most will understandably answer yes . but if you ask those same people ( especially the largest two minority demographics , african and hispanic americans ) whether they genuinely want to leave america or be `` rescued , '' most will answer no , and that is n't just because of `` muh . '' and ignoring race , we can look at general political sentiment too . now , red is in power , so majority blue states do n't it ; que the versa and same pattern happening for every administration since at least the 20th century and in the future . but even in r/losangeles now , you have people in the same comment section slandering ice * an * d downvoting comments that promote cali ceding from the us . this is not the first time political tensions have been high asf post-civil war , and will not be the last . but none of this has ever been to truly end us , or have the majority of people to say `` yeah screw the united country . '' last , i will look at the relationship of the american government and political : 1. starting with an one , scotus . any attempt to use scotus 's perceived political leaning as reason for `` welp there goes democracy '' is and historically imo . scotus has * always * ocellated in political ideology since its inception . it has made many judgements . it is also the reason why we have gay marriage , desegregated schools , and worker 's rights . again , the question remains the same : since scotus 's inception , where are we now ? i 'd argue we are way off now than where we were before the first court presided . the idea that scotus needs to be `` packed '' to save its integrity because some people do n't the current court 's perceived political leaning is both and . scotus is not a indicator of . * i can give you a example with the current court : perceived majority , 6/9 justices being picks by current party ( 3/9 by current president here too ) in power . and yet , since current presidential term began , it is the judicial branch by scotus that has halted the most , and this has included scotus directly . this court has both granted , * and * handed unanimous ; acb , 's latest pick , just shredded his own lawyer two weeks ago . scotus will most likely always be scotus . 2 . * this is not the first time * america has had a `` wtf '' administration , or one perceived to be for the people . a few of them happened up to the civil war , and then ones that reconstruction . then there was hoover to whom the entire population said `` nah this is ass what 's the other option .

The narrative that America (or as some agitators like to call, the ""aMeRiCaN EmPiRe"") is ""collapsing"" or ""dying"" has been floating around for a few years now, mostly in polarized social media spaces detached from reality, and mostly in response to the rise of Trump, the greater conservative populist movement, and political polarity. At first, I just found it annoying because doom and gloom help no one who isn't trying to gain from that message, and hope is always a better avenue. But I have now come to the belief that the idea isn't just annoying, it's historically blatantly untrue and will remain untrue. I've had this thought for a little while now, but I'm finally writing this because of what we are seeing in Los Angeles, so here goes.

My reasoning stems from the idea that this country has made it through *WAY* worse than anything we've seen in the last decade. The saying may be cliche, but I genuinely stand by it when viewing history, both domestically and abroad. America signed the Dec. of Independence in 1776, and was able to begin operating as its own country after the revolutionary war in 1783, so I'm going to be viewing from that year on afterwards.

**I'll begin by looking domestically**. These are the 3 biggest events in my opinion that our nation went through which genuinely had true and full potential to end the country as people knew it:

1. The War of 1812. The British Empire trying to regain what they had lost is genuinely horrifying if you think about it. Imagine gaining independence only to have to fight off the very same oppressive totalitarian aggressor *again* just to keep it. That doesn't usually happen in history, where instead one of 3 things normally happen: conquered territory is never relinquished and forever altered, territory is never conquered, or territory is conquered, but then freed from that specific aggressor forever. We had to engage the very same aggressor, as if Britain could not fathom the idea that it did not have a  to our nation. I feel like the War of 1812 isn't talked about enough because it's the only war since our Revolution where America, as a whole, had to fight another nation not for its benefit or revenge, but for its total survival. But we did it and made it through.
2. Confederacy and Civil War. Self explanatory; country actually did split and resulted in the deadliest war in American history by American casualties because it was Americans fighting Americans. Civil wars normally end in either one side's victory, or permanent fraction. We came out with the former and moved on.
3. Great Depression. America had become one with its industry and industry economy at this point, so what the Great Depression had the potential to do was basically never let us come back. But we came back and moved on (love you FDR).

Before I continue, there were two other events I considered but decided against, and I want to address:

* Chattel slavery. It was horrific and the poster child of the humans rights abuses this country was physically founded upon (in conjunction with native genocide), and we must continue to learn from history. However, for this post, I must look at numbers: since 1783, African Americans, slaves or free,  were never majority of the people in the nation's entirety (not talking about specific states where they actually were at some points). At its peak in 1860, slavery accounted for 4M people, with the total population being around 31.5M. Today, AA's make up 13% of the population. In my opinion, while slavery anywhere is a great argument for QOL and human/civil rights measures, you can't determine the future health/continuation of a nation based on the ill of a genuine numerical minority.
* COVID. Obviously a terrible disaster and may all those affected find health and peace. But when viewing numbers, it took a greater toll on well being and emotional health than it did actual stability. Numbers wise, population was barely scratched (around 1.2M out of around 330M). And while the economy clearly tanked and we will be facing countless problems (mostly mental) in the future because of COVID, we came out pretty well given this was the modern day plague and the world began by having 0 counter. The lockdowns sucked and in 1929, they might have ended us. But this time we had technology and it was honestly that which saved our economy from total collapse like what happened in the GD, and also the reason why despite the economy tanking overall, unlike the GD, there were  increases in many distinct places too (ex: Zoom).

Since the GD, almost everything America has been involved with regarding our health as a nation has been domestic civil political unrest and conflicts abroad, so ones not on American soil, and thus not ones that really threatened the nation's people's lives and thus the nation's continuation. Cold War was terrifying yes, but it didn't amount to shit. Worst artificial attacks against explicitly American life since the civil war (I count COVID as a disease that the whole world had to fight) were Pearl Harbor and 9/11, and while tragic, made us stronger pretty much immediately.

So with the 3 major domestic events above, plus all the major abroad ones and all the littler events in mind, where are we now? A nation around 250 years old (so a a fetus) that has, ballpark, 80%+ of the same civil rights (free speech, worker's rights, women's and racial minority vote and participation, LGBTQ marriage, free practice of religion, etc) as developed and socially progressed nations thousands and thousands of years older than us, enshrined into our law. Practice can be argued to be a different story, and there's always room to improve in every nation, but the recognition of the rights on paper in federal law is what is most important and marks how people will be viewed by the government from there on out; as African Americans were known to say, ""freedom comes first."" And America has been the world leader in military might, economy, technology, and volume of higher education for quite a while now. If we weathered all of that first sentence, and still come out to this degree of historical progress in comparison to other nations, and at the stupidly young age we're at, I find it very hard to believe we're just ""done for"" because of one guy in 8 broken up years. Until we hit events that have the danger  of the 3 I mentioned (no, social media echo chambers fear mongering about a civil war don't count), I believe our history shows we will be fine.

So now to address fears of Trump's government, its perceived erosion of democracy and stability, and any fears of future all out authoritarianism. I may dislike throwing terms like ""fascism"" around. But I do not like Trump (for a plethora of reasons) and think that some of his ideas, at their worst, are directly un-American, and thus I want to validate peoples concerns and address them. I'm going begin by looking globally, then swing back domestically again:

1. I'll begin with *the* example of fascism, Germany. And actually, this doesn't need much explanation. The time gap between Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s and modern day Germany in 2025 is basically a second historically, not even 100 years. Germany didn't just have fears of fascism, they slid directly into it and became *the* case example studied everywhere. Look at where they're at now. Those same major cities, Berlin, Frankfurt, etc are still there. Borders of core German area are still in tact and pretty much as they were prior Austria's annexation. Population increased. And economy and industry, while only revived because of help at first, is now one of the best in the world. So we know for a definitive fact beyond all fear mongering, reasonable doubt, and hopelessness that even when the worst actually literally does come to worst, a nation can come back, prevail, and exist and thrive in the future. No American in the last 100 years has lived under a government that came even close to what Hitler's became. Next.
2. . Again, it's a pretty open and shut argument. What Mao did to his population in numbers makes anything that Hitler, Leopold, and Stalin did, numbers wise, look elementary. The consensus estimate is 15-55M of deaths, with the number 40M being used quite a bit. In other words, too many to actually count. And yet this happened in 1950-60s, and we're in 2025, so an even *shorter* time gap than Germany. Where is  now? Well, this writing is about continued survival of nations, which is dependent on stability and human life. It's not about non-lethal civil rights abuses. I may despise the Chinese government, but in modern day, there are two nations who objectively lead the world in military might and industry.  is one of them. Given what Mao did not even 80 years earlier, that's impressive.

Returning domestically, I'll look at political unrest since the Civil War, beginning with riots. I'll be bias very quickly: the current LA protests are just. But the LA riots are pretty scary. That latter view is shared by pretty much everyone, ranging from ""hey we can protest the ICE raids peacefully without vandalism or waving the Mexican flag"" all the way to flat out racism. We all hate seeing what's happening.

But what I find almost ridiculous is that these riots in the last 5 years, whether they be for Floyd or Gaza or , are somehow being used to say ""yeah we're done."" The summer of 2020 was bad (Minnesotan here, saw it myself). But I don't think anything has happened in the 21st century on American soil with regards to civil unrest that is on par with what we saw in the 20th century; Rodney King, Red Summer, Vietnam demo.'s, Black Panther party, and peaceful MLK demonstrations are all examples off the top of my head. And yet here we are; America is not going to die because of civil unrest lol.

Next, fears of ""life is gonna be shit because \[\*insert political group I disagree with\*\] is in power."" Life is tough lol ofc. But as America keeps progressing at an unparalleled rate compared to the ages of other countries, I think there's a pretty simple reason that riots and civil unrest are becoming less intense and frequent (e.g. 21st vs 20th century): despite any narrative, shit has actually improved for everyone. Yes, as has been the case since America's founding, white people have dominantly reaped the greatest and most improvements in QOL because: a) numbers, as they've always been the largest racial demographic and b) first direct, then systemic racism. But QOL is measured as an average of all, and we do not live in an apartheid state like 20th century South Africa or India, so any improvements in QOL are felt by all, whether it be civil rights, tech, medicine (like vaccines), etc, just in varying quantities. If you ask most racial minorities in this country if they've encountered racism, experienced hardships, or feel like they have ever been treated unfairly, I think most will understandably answer yes. But if you ask those same people (especially the largest two minority demographics, African and Hispanic Americans) whether they genuinely want to leave America or be ""rescued,"" most will answer no, and that isn't just because of ""mUh FrEeDoM."" And ignoring race, we can look at general political sentiment too.  now, Red is in power, so majority Blue states don't love it; que the vice versa and same pattern happening for every administration since at least the 20th century and in the future. But even in r/LosAngeles  now, you have people in the same comment section slandering ICE *an*d downvoting comments that promote Cali ceding from the US. This is not the first time political tensions have been high asf post-civil war, and will not be the last. But none of this has ever been enough to truly end us, or have the majority of people to say ""yeah screw the united country.""

Last, I will look at the relationship of the American government and political stability:

1. Starting with an easy one, SCOTUS. Any attempt to use SCOTUS's perceived political leaning as reason for ""welp there goes democracy"" is ignorant and historically blind imo. SCOTUS has *always* ocellated in political ideology since its inception. It has made many terrible judgements. It is also the reason why we have gay marriage, desegregated schools, and worker's rights. Again, the question remains the same: since SCOTUS's inception, where are we now? I'd argue we are way better off now than where we were before the first court presided. The idea that SCOTUS needs to be ""packed"" to save its integrity because some people don't like the current court's perceived political leaning is both inconsistent and absurd. SCOTUS is not a good indicator of collapse.
   * I can give you a good example with the current court: perceived conservative majority, 6/9 justices being picks by current party (3/9 by current  here too) in power. And yet, since current presidential term began, it is the judicial branch led by SCOTUS that has halted Trump the most, and this has included SCOTUS directly. This court has both granted Trump wins, *and* handed unanimous losses; ACB, Trump's latest pick, just shredded his own lawyer two weeks ago. SCOTUS will most likely always be SCOTUS.
2. *This is not the first time* America has had a ""wtf"" administration, or one perceived to be terrible for the people. A few of them happened leading up to the Civil War, and then ones that failed reconstruction. Then there was Hoover to whom the entire population said ""nah this is ass what's the other option."" But then there's also, among others, Nixon, whose was well into the 20th century. And he fucked up enough to where he was actually gonna be the first ever to be removed from office if he didn't high tail it out of there. We were fine after those presidents, we will be fine after this one.

Finally, and I may get hate for this, but 2A. 2A wasn't put in the constitution for no reason. I highly doubt  now that we will ever see its implied overarching purpose utilized, but who knows. Regardless, while never seen before, the same amendment that grants America a unique problem (gun violence) is the very reason that, beyond our military, we are nearly impossible to invade by eternal nations, or be tyrannized by our own. No civil population has ever in the history of the world been as armed as the American one is. It's also one of many things where party doesn't matter, as guns are owned across the board. There is no world in which the military will want to engage with the genuine American population (we're not talking riots here lol, barely anyone attends those). Technologically we'd get creamed sure, but that's only possible with mass casualties; bombs primarily. And you will be hard pressed to find anyone in the military who will actually follow a ""bomb your fellow civilian on your own soil"" order. So that leaves direct gunfire combat, which is dangerous for everyone involved, and law enforcement and military know this. And none of this considers fractions in the military and law enforcement.

I wrote this to argue that America as a nation will not collapse, and the notion it will is foolish. But just because the general health and survival of a nation remains intact doesn't mean individual losses don't happen and won't happen in the instantaneous, and I want to acknowledge that. Optimism in future stability doesn't invalidate someone's individual hardship. Like every nation, America has a terrible history both domestically and abroad. And just because it has survived, progressed, and thrived with a majority of its population, doesn't mean there weren't many many unjust losses that didn't happen but didn't collapse the US. Example: Jim Crow and COVID are good examples, with America prevailing but the respective losses to African Americans and COVID victims still happening. I think it's also important to acknowledge the difference between loss of modern civil luxury and convenience, and life and stability; and that while the losing the former sucks, it doesn't indicate collapse and is not the same as losing the latter. Like how  from war torn countries don't move because they can't get an abortion, they move because there is no country. Or how, despite their civil freedoms being in the toilet,  isn't going to collapse because their government rigged an election. Best thing we can do imo is to keep our heads up and faith in each other, look at history, see where people have gotten and progressed to in the long run despite challenges, and go from there. Cheers","opinion ( long ) : given the history of internal and external examples , the  will not and will be absolutely * * tldr ; we 're lol * * the narrative that america ( or as some agitators to call , the `` american empire '' ) is `` collapsing '' or `` '' has been floating around for a few years now , mostly in polarized social media spaces detached from reality , and mostly in response to the rise of , the greater populist movement , and political polarity . at first , i just found it because and help no one who is n't trying to from that message , and hope is always a avenue . but i have now come to the belief that the idea is n't just , it 's historically and will remain . i 've had this thought for a little while now , but i 'm finally writing this because of what we are seeing in los angeles , so here goes . my reasoning stems from the idea that this country has made it through * way * than anything we 've seen in the last decade . the saying may be , but i genuinely stand by it when viewing history , both domestically and abroad . america signed the dec. of independence in 1776 , and was able to begin operating as its own country after the war in 1783 , so i 'm going to be viewing from that year on afterwards . * * i 'll begin by looking domestically * * . these are the 3 biggest events in my opinion that our nation went through which genuinely had true and full potential to end the country as people knew it : 1. the war of 1812. the british empire trying to regain what they had is genuinely if you think about it . imagine independence only to have to fight off the very same * again * just to keep it . that does n't usually happen in history , where instead one of 3 things normally happen : conquered territory is never relinquished and forever altered , territory is never conquered , or territory is conquered , but then from that specific forever . we had to engage the very same , as if britain could not fathom the idea that it did not have a to our nation . i feel the war of 1812 is n't talked about because it 's the only war since our revolution where america , as a whole , had to fight another nation not for its or , but for its total . but we did it and made it through . 2. confederacy and civil war . self explanatory ; country actually did and resulted in the deadliest war in american history by american casualties because it was americans fighting americans . civil wars normally end in either one side 's , or permanent fraction . we came out with the former and moved on . 3. . america had become one with its industry and industry economy at this point , so what the had the potential to do was basically never let us come back . but we came back and moved on ( you fdr ) . before i continue , there were two other events i considered but decided against , and i want to address : * chattel slavery . it was and the poster child of the humans rights this country was physically founded upon ( in conjunction with native ) , and we must continue to learn from history . however , for this post , i must look at numbers : since 1783 , african americans , or , were never majority of the people in the nation 's entirety ( not talking about specific states where they actually were at some points ) . at its peak in 1860 , slavery accounted for 4m people , with the total population being around 31.5m . today , aa 's make up 13 % of the population . in my opinion , while slavery anywhere is a argument for qol and human/civil rights measures , you ca n't determine the future health/continuation of a nation based on the ill of a numerical minority . * covid . obviously a and may all those affected find health and . but when viewing numbers , it took a greater on being and emotional health than it did actual . numbers , population was barely ( around 1.2m out of around 330m ) . and while the economy and we will be facing countless ( mostly mental ) in the future because of covid , we came out given this was the day and the world began by having 0 counter . the lockdowns and in 1929 , they might have ended us . but this time we had technology and it was honestly that which saved our economy from total what happened in the gd , and also the reason why despite the economy tanking overall , unlike the gd , there were  increases in many distinct places too ( ex : zoom ) . since the gd , almost everything america has been involved with regarding our health as a nation has been domestic civil political and abroad , so ones not on american soil , and thus not ones that really threatened the nation 's people 's lives and thus the nation 's continuation . war was terrifying yes , but it did n't amount to . artificial against explicitly american life since the civil war ( i count covid as a disease that the whole world had to fight ) were pearl harbor and 9/11 , and while , made us much immediately . so with the 3 major domestic events above , plus all the major abroad ones and all the littler events in mind , where are we now ? a nation around 250 years old ( so a a fetus ) that has , ballpark , 80 % + of the same civil rights ( speech , worker 's rights , women 's and racial minority vote and participation , lgbtq marriage , practice of religion , etc ) as developed and socially progressed nations thousands and thousands of years older than us , enshrined into our law . practice can be argued to be a different story , and there 's always room to in every nation , but the recognition of the rights on paper in federal law is what is most and marks how people will be viewed by the government from there on out ; as african americans were known to say , `` comes first . '' and america has been the world leader in military might , economy , technology , and volume of higher education for quite a while now . if we weathered all of that first sentence , and still come out to this degree of historical in comparison to other nations , and at the young age we 're at , i find it very to believe we 're just `` done for '' because of one guy in 8 up years . until we hit events that have the  of the 3 i mentioned ( no , social media echo chambers mongering about a civil war do n't count ) , i believe our history shows we will be . so now to address of 's government , its perceived of democracy and , and any of future all out authoritarianism . i may throwing terms `` '' around . but i do not ( for a plethora of reasons ) and think that some of his ideas , at their , are directly un-american , and thus i want to validate peoples and address them . i 'm going begin by looking globally , then swing back domestically again : 1. i 'll begin with * the * example of , germany . and actually , this does n't need much explanation . the time gap between hitler 's rise to power in the 1930s and day germany in 2025 is basically a second historically , not even 100 years . germany did n't just have of , they slid directly into it and became * the * case example studied everywhere . look at where they 're at now . those same major cities , berlin , frankfurt , etc are still there . borders of core german area are still in tact and much as they were prior austria 's annexation . population increased . and economy and industry , while only revived because of help at first , is now one of the in the world . so we know for a definitive fact beyond all mongering , , and that even when the actually literally does come to , a nation can come back , prevail , and exist and in the future . no american in the last 100 years has lived under a government that came even close to what hitler 's became . next . 2.  . again , it 's a open and shut argument . what mao did to his population in numbers makes anything that hitler , leopold , and stalin did , numbers , look elementary . the consensus estimate is 15-55m of deaths , with the number 40m being used quite a bit . in other words , too many to actually count . and yet this happened in 1950-60s , and we 're in 2025 , so an even * shorter * time gap than germany . where is  now ? , this writing is about continued of nations , which is dependent on and human life . it 's not about non-lethal civil rights . i may the chinese government , but in day , there are two nations who objectively the world in military might and industry .  is one of them . given what mao did not even 80 years earlier , that 's . returning domestically , i 'll look at political since the civil war , beginning with riots . i 'll be very quickly : the current la are just . but the la riots are . that latter view is shared by much everyone , ranging from `` hey we can the ice raids without vandalism or waving the mexican flag '' all the way to flat out . we all seeing what 's happening . but what i find almost is that these riots in the last 5 years , whether they be for floyd or gaza or  , are somehow being used to say `` yeah we 're done . '' the summer of 2020 was ( minnesotan here , saw it myself ) . but i do n't think anything has happened in the 21st century on american soil with regards to civil that is on par with what we saw in the 20th century ; rodney king , red summer , vietnam demo . 's , black panther party , and mlk demonstrations are all examples off the of my head . and yet here we are ; america is not going to because of civil lol . next , of `` life is gon na be because \ [ \ * insert political group i with\ * \ ] is in power . '' life is lol ofc . but as america keeps progressing at an rate compared to the ages of other countries , i think there 's a simple reason that riots and civil are becoming less and frequent ( e.g . 21st vs 20th century ) : despite any narrative , has actually for everyone . yes , as has been the case since america 's founding , white people have dominantly reaped the and most in qol because : a ) numbers , as they 've always been the largest racial demographic and b ) first direct , then systemic . but qol is measured as an average of all , and we do not live in an apartheid state 20th century south africa or india , so any in qol are felt by all , whether it be civil rights , tech , medicine ( vaccines ) , etc , just in varying quantities . if you ask most racial minorities in this country if they 've encountered , experienced , or feel they have ever been treated , i think most will understandably answer yes . but if you ask those same people ( especially the largest two minority demographics , african and hispanic americans ) whether they genuinely want to leave america or be `` rescued , '' most will answer no , and that is n't just because of `` muh . '' and ignoring race , we can look at general political sentiment too . now , red is in power , so majority blue states do n't it ; que the versa and same pattern happening for every administration since at least the 20th century and in the future . but even in r/losangeles now , you have people in the same comment section slandering ice * an * d downvoting comments that promote cali ceding from the us . this is not the first time political tensions have been high asf post-civil war , and will not be the last . but none of this has ever been to truly end us , or have the majority of people to say `` yeah screw the united country . '' last , i will look at the relationship of the american government and political : 1. starting with an one , scotus . any attempt to use scotus 's perceived political leaning as reason for `` welp there goes democracy '' is and historically imo . scotus has * always * ocellated in political ideology since its inception . it has made many judgements . it is also the reason why we have gay marriage , desegregated schools , and worker 's rights . again , the question remains the same : since scotus 's inception , where are we now ? i 'd argue we are way off now than where we were before the first court presided . the idea that scotus needs to be `` packed '' to save its integrity because some people do n't the current court 's perceived political leaning is both and . scotus is not a indicator of . * i can give you a example with the current court : perceived majority , 6/9 justices being picks by current party ( 3/9 by current  here too ) in power . and yet , since current presidential term began , it is the judicial branch by scotus that has halted the most , and this has included scotus directly . this court has both granted , * and * handed unanimous ; acb , 's latest pick , just shredded his own lawyer two weeks ago . scotus will most likely always be scotus . 2 . * this is not the first time * america has had a `` wtf '' administration , or one perceived to be for the people . a few of them happened up to the civil war , and then ones that reconstruction . then there was hoover to whom the entire population said `` nah this is ass what 's the other option . '' but then there 's also , among others , nixon , whose was into the 20th century . and he fucked up to where he was actually gon na be the first ever to be removed from office if he did n't high tail it out of there . we were after those presidents , we will be after this one . finally , and i may get for this , but 2a . 2a was n't put in the constitution for no reason . i highly now that we will ever see its implied overarching purpose utilized , but who knows . regardless , while never seen before , the same amendment that grants america a unique ( gun violence ) is the very reason that , beyond our military , we are nearly to invade by eternal nations , or be tyrannized by our own . no civil population has ever in the history of the world been as armed as the american one is . it 's also one of many things where party does n't matter , as guns are owned across the board . there is no world in which the military will want to engage with the american population ( we 're not talking riots here lol , barely anyone attends those ) . technologically we 'd get creamed sure , but that 's only possible with mass casualties ; bombs primarily . and you will be pressed to find anyone in the military who will actually follow a `` your fellow civilian on your own soil '' order . so that leaves direct gunfire combat , which is for everyone involved , and law enforcement and military know this . and none of this considers fractions in the military and law enforcement . i wrote this to argue that america as a nation will not , and the notion it will is . but just because the general health and of a nation remains intact does n't mean individual do n't happen and wo n't happen in the instantaneous , and i want to acknowledge that . in future does n't someone 's individual . every nation , america has a history both domestically and abroad . and just because it has survived , progressed , and thrived with a majority of its population , does n't mean there were n't many many that did n't happen but did n't the us . example : jim crow and covid are examples , with america prevailing but the respective to african americans and covid victims still happening . i think it 's also to acknowledge the difference between of civil and , and life and ; and that while the the former , it does n't indicate and is not the same as the latter . how  from war torn countries do n't move because they ca n't get an abortion , they move because there is no country . or how , despite their civil being in the toilet ,  is n't going to because their government rigged an election . thing we can do imo is to keep our heads up and in each other , look at history , see where people have gotten and progressed to in the long run despite challenges , and go from there . cheers"

In May 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration’s move to end TPS and humanitarian parole for migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Cuba. Over 500,000 people lost the legal protections that let them live and work in the U.S. practically overnight.

## Today's Discussion

Walmart is starting to enforce compliance, which means terminating staff who’ve worked there for years simply because their legal status was erased by policy.

[A screenshot is posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1l52259/evidentially_a_walmart_is_going_to_be_doing_this/) to /r/Walmart of an internal discussion about specific associates who are likely to be terminated.

## Some Choice Excerpts

### Why didn't your friend get their citizenship?

> Yes, we lost some too. Not their fault either as they've had their renewal in for months. They're just simply not being processed.
>> Yeah, my friend lost his job at another retail because his work permit wasn't renewed yet. Luckily he's gotten it now and got a new job, but it's ridiculous. Bro's been here since he was 5, this country is essentially all he knows. Just horrid.
>>> He has been on a permit for that long?
>>>> I'm honestly not too sure, I haven't ever asked point-blank about his citizenship lol. I know he was going to join the military a few years back, but wasn't able to due to changes DJT made to qualifications to join.
>>>> 
>>>> I'm gonna make a big assumption that he planned on being naturalized through joining and since they did away with that, he wasn't able to. I'm also gonna say this dude isn't the smartest and I'm not either so either one of us could be wrong in how I'm interpreting it lol.
>>>> 
>>>> ETA it may be more complicated than him having a green card for so long etc., I have another friend who married my friend that's a US citizen a couple years ago, but she still won't be a citizen for years and has to spend thousands to renew her green card every so often. Citizenship isn't very straightforward.
>>>>> Citizenship isn’t straightforward and that’s the problem. I’m not opposed to removing a shit ton of illegal immigrants but citizenship should have a very simple and straightforward path so that many of these illegal immigrants who honestly should be legal can become legal. For years I’ve said you can’t mass deport if you don’t make it accessible and easily understood how to become legal
>>>>>> You’re not wrong at all in that sentiment, unfortunately nobody in positions of power the past 30yrs have felt like fixing that issue.
>>>>>>> I was really expecting Obama to do it but I think between the DNC and the constant fighting back from the Republicans, he never made it happen

>>>> It ain’t exactly free. It’s not trumps million dollar golden pass but it cost a few hundreds to pay for the process. People born here take it for granted that we never had to pay or take a test most adults would fail. So I usually don’t judge people.

>>>>> It’s not a few hundreds. Just finished this process yesterday - from green card (conditional) to green card (non conditional) to citizenship for my spouse.

>>>>> Initial green card (2-years conditional status) Form I-130 $625 Form I-485 $1440

>>>>> Remove conditional status (10-year green card) Form I-751 $750

>>>>> Citizenship N-400 $710

>>>>> Fees alone - that’s $3,525.

>>>>> Add $2-3k for a lawyer throughout the process (didn’t use one for the N-400) and you’re looking at $5,500-$6,500.

>>>>>> This is why I said I don’t really judge people on it. The average American doesn’t know anything about the process and a lot of people really think it’s just a hop skip and a jump into a government office and you’re a citizen. It’s a lot, and this is perfect case scenario I’m guessing, with no Trump bs to interfere.

>> If he's been here that long, why hadn't he applied for citizenship?

>>> Who says he hadn’t? It’s not as easy and basic as applying for an apartment or car loan. It takes YEARS and can cost thousands. Not everybody has that kind of time or money.

>>>> You can also be deported or put on a list for just applying. Being illegal isn’t some easy ‘just work and don’t do crimes’ type of living like some people think. ICE vans literally raided several Hispanic neighborhoods in my old town yearly, deporting many hard working people who just want to live here and work.

>>>> There’s also language barriers, complexity of applying like you said, no government help to guide them, and no straight forward path.

>>> It's not always that easy. My friends mother took over 25 years to become a citizen, and not because of a lack of trying.

>> Dude there are people who have filed and have been waiting for insane lengths of time. Then there are people who finally get their hearings only to arrive, have their cases closed and visas revoked, then get detained immediately upon exiting the court room.

>> So fuck off.

>>> Yes, this is a new tactic the feds are using where they motion to dismiss a removal proceeding so that you walk out of the court then they arrest you again and put you in expedited removal which removes you from jurisdiction of the immigration court.

>>> If you have an attorney, you want to give them the heads up so they can motion against the dismissal of your removal if the government tries this.

>>> It sounds odd that the defense would motion to continue a removal proceeding, but it's better than ending up in expedited removal because it keeps the case in front of the court.

>>> The dismissal sounds like a good thing, but you actually don't want it because they'll be waiting for you in the lobby and you're going to get a much worse process than a removal proceeding in front of the court.

>> Been here since he was 5 and still won't even try to gain citizenship!? Time to go back to his homeland.

>>> Yeah I don't know why he didn't just scamper on over to the citizenship store and pick up a family pack.

----

### A discussion on ""illigals""

> What do they need to re-verify??

>> Eligibility to be employed in the United States. (Green card, visa or citizenship status)

>>> You mean so people who are here illigally cant work?

>>>> They are literally here legally if they’re impacted by this lmfao

### A manager chimes in and is shamed for their hiring practices

> We lost 32 ppl. All of my cart pushers, all of deli, and most of the ODP team. It’s bad.

>> So now what do they expect dude? I mean sure people might still shop and work there but for how much longer???? The store can only run on so many people efficiently and turnover rates are already outrageous. I hate working here

>>> What do you mean what are they gonna do? 😂 they are going to hire new people lol I think people fail to realize how many applicants we get at Walmart lol

---

>>> They will just hire US Citizens who are unemployed and need work...

>>>> To do jobs they already turned their nose up at? A lot of people are unemployed by choice, it's just not the ones you think it is

>>>>> They'll have to pay people a wage they will accept to do that job.

>>>>>> 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂 Wait….you don’t actually believe that do you? Walmart would rather close down then pay a livable wage.

>>>>> Then the parents of those unemployed people should kick them out. People shouldn’t just be sitting on their ass all day and night

>>>>>> Why have unemployed people living with their parents/friends when you can have homeless people on the streets instead lol

>>>>>>> Well why are they not working? Being a bum living with your parents is more bum behavior than being homeless, at least homeless people know how to hustle

>>>>>>>> Could be they apply for a job, and they give the job to people for will work for dollars less and don't speak English

>>>>>>>>> Walmart has standardized starting wages so that's a silly claim

>>> Honestly what I noticed is that all of the people at my store that were here from one of the banned countries, stayed here a long time and didn’t quit unlike a lot of American employees I’ve seen quit within a week. Also they were very hard workers and kind. I highly doubt it’s going to be easy to replace them. They gave us an amazing team and this is a devastating loss.

---

>>> Idk why ppl down voting . Its true. Hire ppl than can speak english. Just heard a store in miam lost 150 ppl. Im 100 % barely any of them spoke it And fail to assimilate. For reference. Im litertally half hispanic so i cant be racist since in non white according to librals/democrats.

>> Hire people with their I-9 documents instead of hiring illegal aliens and figuring nobody will ever do anything about it?

>>> I don't think you have been paying attention, but this isn't about illegal immigrants. I cannot understand for the life of me how people are not picking up on the fact that this is about people on work visas, people who ARE here legally and have been from the beginning. It's pretty much impossible for an undocumented (AKA ILLEGAL) immigrant to get a work visa from inside the US so it should be obvious it's not about them.

>>>> He’s maga… you think he understands the difference? They don’t get nuance or laws or facts lol.

>>>>> I actually voted for Harris and despise this administration.

>>> These were people who were legally working here until (by unconstitutional executive order) they suddenly didn't have the proper paper. These folks weren't the ones breaking the law here...

>>>> What legal status granted by the Immigration and Nationality Acts were they under?

>>>> Also, the Supreme Court said that it was legal for the Secretary of Homeland Security to rescind TPS. So that's the end of the line on that, and they ruled it was legal.

>>>>> You mean the Supreme Court that is following trump illegally and going against the constitution and the law as it’s written? We get it you’re MAGA, but he broke the law.

>>>>> But hey if you don’t care if you can go shop because a King decided a new law was allowed and his cronies allowed it to continue, more for you. Enjoy the higher prices, and slower lines. I look forward to your Karen video ranting about how slow Walmart is on YouTube.

>>>>>> If Ruth Bader Ginsburg had retired gracefully, then there'd be one less Republican on the Supreme Court.

>>>>>>She held on and died of cancer. This is what happens when you elevate a narcissist to sainthood when they screwed all of us.

>> Stores DO NOT hire undocumented people. Every single person hired is verified eligible to work. I worked HR for 2 years. What you stated is just 100% false.

---

>> Your lack of reading comprehension and basic understanding the difference between work visas vs ""illegal aliens"" is horrible.

>>> I've dealt with USCIS a lot. I know what I'm talking about.

>>>>Sure whatever you say random reddit user.

>> Only they were here legally

>>> That's actually not true.

>>> Item 1: The DHS canceled their TPS. The Supreme Court upheld this.

>>> Item 2: The printed expiration date on an EAD doesn't matter if USCIS canceled the card, the card is revoked immediately.

>>> Item 3: If they continue to work on an invalid EAD, it's not only a problem for Walmart, it's a problem for them. If they file another USCIS or ICE petition, they have to say YES that they have worked without authorization before.

>>> (Item 3 is only forgiven automatically for spouses of US citizens. It's still best to be able to answer NO.)

>>> Item 4: My spouse is a naturalized US citizen. I know a lot more than you do. We had to send thousands of pages to USCIS and pay a lot of expensive fees. I know a lot of their rules and regulations. You probably don't.

>>>> Key word is they were here legally before this know my team is gonna lose good workers.

### Another manager appears and this one deserves a spanking?

> My heart sank when I got this communication. I spoke to all 63 associates individually and made sure they knew I did not agree with this.

>> I can't imagine how gut-wrenching that was on a one on one basis

----

>> So you hired 63 people who didn't have I-9 documents and just turned a blind eye to it? How the hell did you have 63 people hired with no I-9 documents?

>> This deserves a spanking.

>> Everyone with legal permission to work should have something that proves it. This includes:

>> An Unrestricted Social Security Card (one that doesn't say Not Valid for work without DHS/INS Authorization) (The old ones said INS.)

>> A Real ID driver's license or State ID.

>> A US Passport or US Passport Card.

>> A Valid Unexpired Employment Authorization Document issued to legal immigrants by USCIS.

>> Various other documents that are all on the list, including some that INS last issued in the 1970s.

>> I hope that if you've knowingly looked the other way, that they fine your store millions of dollars, you deserve it. And if that's what happened, I think you deserve to be fired for this. That is beyond incompetent. This would be criminal.

>>> That’s not how it works. They MUST have a valid I-9 to work. The Walmart system will not hire them and process them if they do not. It’s their work permits & renewals that are not being processed by the Government so legally they are no longer allowed to work.

>>>>  Maybe this store manager should just quit breaking the law (if in fact they hired 63 people who lack work authorization, if in fact that is what happened here) and if they have trouble finding legal workers, they raise their wage.

>>>>  Businesses always try to figure out ways to be cheap and screw workers. When businesses hire unauthorized workers who will work for anything, that can be one way to accomplish that.

>>>>> You struggle with reading comprehension don’t you?

>>>>>> I also doubt any Walmart manager has a heart, much less that it sank unless they were contemplating having to raise wages to hire legal workers.

>>>>>> When I worked at Walmart, we had the nastiest store manager I think ever existed. We had her printing out threatening letters about people accidentally getting one minute over their schedule and taping them to the time clocks.

>>>>>> ""NO OVERTIME!!!! NOT ONE TICK!!!!""

### Not going after the criminals

> I thought dumbass was only going after ""criminals"" now he's just deporting people to hurt them.

>> Yes, this is the problem. They are simply snatching up non-citizens even with work visas and permits rejecting them. Yet it seeme to primarily affect persons of color. Many forget that we very much do have ""illegal aliens"" of European descent from Canada, France, England, etc. without citizenship here as well.

### A discussion on I-9 and the ""Rape Gangs"" of Haiti

> I-9 verification is important as it is there to make sure that jobs in the economy are given to US citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, people waiting to adjust their status who have an Employment Authorization Document, and various others who have a right to work in this country.

> It is very important to make sure that people who are not in the country legally are not working without authorization, especially during a downturn in the economy.

> The law has always said employers who knowingly or negligently hire people without authorization to work in the United States face fines and potentially other sanctions, but nobody enforced it.

> When this happens, wages are driven down and people who have the right to work have more trouble finding any job.

> HR people need to be very careful who they hire because this administration isn't screwing around anymore, and this is something I happen to agree with. If you have a right to work in this country, then you will have an I-9 document. If you don't have the I-9 document that was issued to you, you'd better get cracking on a replacement, if it's going to expire, you'd better get cracking on renewing it.

>> They are revoking their visas. Can't make it any clearer. They were here legally. They were working legally. Trump administration decided to revoke them to Make America Great Again. HIS WORDS. Over 300,000 workers lost their work visas in one swipe of a pen May 30th.

>> How do you guys miss this news? It's everywhere. Students are getting visas revoked from those countries too especially China.

>>> Yes, revoked status revokes the EAD too, which means you are employing these people illegally and they are working illegally as of the date the card was canceled, which may be well in advance of the printed date. It doesn't matter if they were here legally. They are not now. And if you continue to employ them, that's on you.

>>>> You know what. Fuck this attitude. They had the authorization to work, they were here under a protected status. They were doing everything they were supposed to do, but now they just get fucked because of the jackass in the white house. And then there's people like you tripping all over themselves to justify it. The President is fucking them over, and people like you are going along with it, but you want to act like it's the immigrants' fault.

>>>> This is nothing more than the banality of evil, someone hiding behind bureaucratic bullshit to justify pulling the rug out from under people who haven't done anything wrong.

>>>>> Exactly and this bozo trying his best to justify it when he didn't even have a clue bringing DACA in to it just proves it's happening right in front of people but they do not give a shit likely because they think they'll get more hours or something. I can't even with this shit. I saw my son's father taken years ago and he was a victim of child labor trafficking, after we'd been told he had a solid case. I have learned way more about immigration law than I ever wanted to, only to see the system kill his spirit, rob us of our family, and he's probably dead now considering how they left him when they dumped him in a country he didn't know AT ALL, just where he was born. Spanish wasn't even his first language and they just did not give a shit and nobody does if they have been conditioned to think immigrants are a net negative.

>>>>  Walmart is not USCIS or ICE. Walmart is not the Immigration Court. Walmart is not a federal court.

>>>> Walmart can only employ people who pass I-9 verification, that's the law.

>>>> If Walmart wants to break the law, there are fines. There are prisons.

>>>> Walmart is not going to pay fines or have its executives arrested, so guess what happens.

>>>>> Don't be obtuse jackass. I'm talking about their authorization revoked by USCIS and/or ICE per the President's instructions.

>>>>> For someone who ""dealt with USCIS a lot"" you should have been able to figure that out. But instead, you're going to act like you don't understand what I'm referring to. You're just playing dumb at this point. You keep carrying on about how Walmart can only employ people who pass i-9 verification, when the ENTIRE FUCKING POINT WAS THAT THEY DID RIGHT UP UNTIL THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO REVOKE THEIR AUTHORISATION. People keep pointing that out to you, but you completely fucking ignore it.

>>>> Also, the banality of evil was a book about how utterly normal the people behind the Holocaust were.

>>>> There's a big difference between ""The conditions that made you eligible for TPS no longer exist in your country, here's a plane ticket and $1,000 for you and every family member to go home now."" and the Holocaust.

>>>> You are committing Holocaust Inversion.

>>>> $1,000 for each member of the family doesn't sound like much but for most of these people, that goes quite a ways in their home country.

>>>> Most people in those countries don't earn $50 if they work for an entire month. So while it may sound like an insult to you, that's actually a lot of money in some of those countries. It'll get them back on their feet again when they land.

>>>>> Oh yeah, let's revoke the TPS status for people from fucking Haiti, because we know that country is just doing fucking great right now.

>>>>> Also you misunderstand the concept of the banality of evil, it wasn't just about how normal the people behind the holocaust were. It was also about how many people who committed evil acts, were not necessarily motivated by monstrous desires or impulses, but much more mundane or seemingly benign motivations like ""Just following orders,"" or ""just following the law.""

>>>>> And that's why I think it applies to you. You don't care that these people's lives are being upended. You don't care that they're getting fucked over by a capricious decision by the administration, because hey it's legal. So it's ok then.

>>>>>> I think Haiti's problem dates back to throwing out the French. And now instead of the French, it's the warlords and rape gangs fighting in the streets with mortars and AK-47s.

>>>>>>> Yeah, that is the problem. And now, the Haitians who have had their TPS status revoked, now get to go back to that. But hey, the President did it and the Supreme Court signed off on it, so everything is a-ok right? Sure, they might catch a bullet. A mortar might fall on their head, but they don't have valid documentation anymore clearly they have to go back right? Right.

>>>>>>>> I love CNN. Only CNN could describe warlords and rape gangs as ""armed men"".

>>>>>>>> Anyway, yeah Haiti is totally screwed up. The UN should be putting Peacekeepers there.

>>>>>>>> The optics of having European soldiers in Haiti would be more desirable than warlords and rape gangs. The UN is completely ineffectual.

>>>>>>>>> And none of what you just said addresses the singular point of, we're going to be sending people back to that.

>>>>>>>>> Instead you want to talk about what the UN should do. Well, they aren't fucking doing it, so what the UN is or isn't doing, is neither here nor there.

>>>>>>>>> We're sending them to the place that's run by gangs, and you seem to be alright with that, because hey, they don't have valid documentation. But hey, it's not all bad right, they can get $1000 dollars and some plane tickets.

>>>>>>>>>> They actually don't automatically get deported. They can of course apply for humanitarian or refugee status, and if they stay and get put into deportation proceedings, they have a right to ask for protection from removal from the Immigration Court.

>>>>>>>>>> There are still options, but TPS is not one of them.

>>>>>>>>>> If you want to help these people, tell them to go file for unemployment. They may actually get it since it's not their fault they lost their jobs.
>>>>>>>>>>> No, they actually won't get unemployment. You have to legally be able to work in order to qualify for unemployment.

>> You are completely wrong.

>> Not partially, but completely.

>> I'm dealing with this directly and the people I'm about to fire have EADs that are listed to be up to 330 days from now. They didn't forget to renew. A bunch of people have paperwork stating their new category EAD is coming in a couple of months. That doesn't matter to Trump.

>> What does matter is they came in under the humanitarian aid. Since they came in from a Biden act, Trump found an easy way to screw over non-whites and the Dems by going after a small subset of people. Small in this case being 500k or so people.

>> Completely wrong. Everything was legal and groovy till Trump wanted to be a fascist.

>>> I am actually not wrong.

>>> The date on the printed card is irrelevant if USCIS cancels the card. The card becomes invalid regardless.

>>> So yes, it's possible to have a card they issued yesterday and canceled today come up as not valid when you run it.

>>> When your status in the country that they issued the card under lapses, the card is junk. It's trash.

>>> This also happens to people who file for Green Cards if their I-485 is DENIED. The EAD expires immediately no matter what the expiration date is on the card.

>>> If you continue to work past the date the card is canceled, then it is VERY bad if you manage to file another petition with USCIS because you have to tell them YES when it asks if you have EVER worked without authorization.

>>> Unauthorized work question is only forgiven automatically for spouses of US citizens, and it's still not a good look.

>>>> Your first post was all about how it's bad to hire illegals and how it's very important to hire people with the right I-9 documents.

>>>> They got hired legally and with the proper documents.

>>>> Don't move the damn goalposts. You bitched about the legality of the initial hire and how they need to keep current on their documents. Everything was legal at the time and I'm seeing a lot of receipts for my workers paying the Government 1444$ to get a new card that would arrive literal months before their current EAD was set to expire.

>>>> What Trump did was legal. I know this. Legal doesn't mean moral, and these actions are all to screw over the immigrant population.

>>>>> When an EAD is canceled, it is invalid immediately, regardless of the printed date.

>>>>> If they had their petition terminated by USCIS or their TPS was canceled, and this leads to the EAD being revoked, if they continue working, that's illegal. Walmart has to re-verify them for PRECISELY this reason, you know.

>>>>> The employer has to get rid of them when it becomes aware they are not allowed to work.

>>>>> Apparently Walmart loaded up on Biden's peasants who would work for anything, to bust wages, and now your stores are losing 10-20% of their workers, I guess?

>>>>> Pardon me while I play the world's smallest violin for you.

>>>>> Well, sounds like a tough story. Maybe raise wages a few bucks and see if any Americans or Green Card holders need work. I do not know what else to tell you, bub.

>>>>>> So you want the people who are contributing to society to quit? Are you going to pick up their work?

>>>>>>> If they have a valid EAD and they want it to be processed on time, they need to file well ahead of time for a renewal using an I-765. Filing it online makes sure the application doesn't get lost in the mail.

>>>>>>> The post office is very unreliable and you can guarantee that it will at least add between 5-15 days in transit (especially with the cutbacks). There is also a slight chance it will get lost and then the EAD will expire and you will have no extension letter because that happened.

>>>>>>> Filing on paper will also get your application in a mail sorting room or on someone's desk for a while. USCIS and their contractors are laying off. Filing electronically skips the part where someone has to crack it open and feed it into a scanner.

>>>>>>> Once the system recognizes the filing, you will get a receipt notice telling you that your EAD has been extended. As of the last time I checked, many are being extended for 2-4 years, so you need to have that receipt and the expired EAD, otherwise you cannot verify and you will lose your job.

>>>>>>> I do not want even one person who has a legal right to work in the United States to lose their job just because of paperwork. If you have a right to an EAD card, you need to be proactive in renewing it in time to at least have the extension letter and the expired EAD in hand when your employer says you need to recertify.

>>>>>>> Filing immigration benefits, is turning into the same situation as tax filings. People who still insist on paper find that their tax filing may be sitting on someone's desk unopened two or three years later. You should NEVER file ANYTHING with USCIS on paper unless that petition has no electronic option. It's not a good idea. It will just gum everything up.

>>>>>>> If you owe a fee, it can also be difficult to find the correct fee on the schedule if you file with paper, and the fee will be higher. Anything sent in with the wrong fee risks having the entire packet rejected, often after months. Electronic forms have you pay the correct fees, always.

>>>>>>>> You keep going on about valid EADs but you are keeping out the part where it was valid until Trump said it wasn't and people aren't being given time to renew theirs. But something tells me that I am talking to a brick wall.

>>>>>>>> Is America great yet? How come the richest country in the world not be able to support illegal immigrants? Could it be that America isn't as Great as people make it seem?

>>>>>>>>> It does not really matter why they're not valid if they're not valid and there's no way to get a valid EAD again. You can talk to an attorney if you think it will help or there's some other legal reason for being here, but they don't make the laws, they can only help explain them to you and make your case if you have one.

>>>>>>>>> I'm not saying it's right. I'm not making a moral judgment here. The law says the President gives TPS and the President takes it away. If you're a citizen and don't like what's going on in our country, and it bothers you this much, go vote.

>>>>>>>>> Go vote a ballot.

>>>>>>>>> We live in a country where a lot of people complain but nobody stops things like this from happening, by picking up a ballot, filling it out, and dropping it in the box.

>>>>>>>>> So now we have a crazy racist old lunatic that's destroying our economy, who was put there by religious extremists and other idiots. That's what happens when people won't spend five minutes voting. (Other than those people.)

>>>>>>>>>> I did vote. I voted against this.

>>>>>>>>>> Trump isn't even catching any actual illegal immigrants. The ones that are getting deported already are in the system. Some even had pending court cases to get permanent residency status. He's going after the easy ones.

>>>>>>>>>>> If you have a pending I-485 and you have a criminal record, expect ICE to be at your USCIS appointment.

>> How do i explain this to you without using crayons...

>> These employees came into the country LEGALLY. They got the paperwork approved. They did everything correctly. They were doing good.

>> Then Trump signed papers with his tiny hands REVOKING their citizenship overnight without cause.

>> This made the people who came into our country the legal way have their visas and papers absolutely worthless in an instant despite them having done no crimes.

>> Walmart, who checks visa and shit before hiring them, suddenly had to reverify to comply with our shitty hitler.

>> Nod if you understand. I am prepared to whip out crayons for you if needed.

>>> Actually Kristi Noem signed the papers.

>>> TPS is not a legal status. It's something the President can use to admit people who don't qualify to be admitted. (Yes, I know that statement does not seem to be logical, but this is often how the INA works.)

>>> If they can re-verify their (now) expired EADs, they get to keep their jobs. If they can't, then they have to be let go because they are NO LONGER in the country with ANY status or program.

### Apparently some of them are bad workers

> It's true, and incredibly sad & frustrating. Good people are losing their jobs because the Trump Administration is obsessed with taking away people's civil liberties.

> Now they think America doesn't want them, and they don't feel safe returning to their country full of internal strife.

>> Lol the ppl that got fired were here 6 months and could barely work 1 pallet of detergant in chemicals, or take all night in paper. Pretty much milk everything. If they do finsh they get mad when their sent to other departments. Like its your job.

### Don't come here illegally

> ok then don’t come here illegally

>> They didn’t. They were here legally until Trump revoked their TPS designation and SCOTUS just upheld his right to do so. They were legally here until like, last week.

### The same conversation again

> It’s almost like you need to have documentation to be able to work in the United States, idk man

>> It’s almost like the stacked Supreme Court just flushed a bunch of documentation down the drain, rug pulling folks who were perfectly legal to work up until that point.


>>> It was voted 7-2 which means even one of the judges considered liberal supported it.

>> THEY HAD DOCUMENTATION.

>> Would it really be so hard to keep up with important news in our country?

---

>> It's almost like they DO though. We get it, reading is hard


### A hot take is posted

> Here's a very hated opinion, it's overdue and needs to happen. I know that it sucks and some good associates will be lost. Those crying for people who have been here ""since they were kids"" have literally had their whole lives to become citizens. It is not an easy process, it is not quick. But it needs to happen. Our country is in a period of change where there will be complaining, as there always is with change. Those on government assistance have to get jobs, those on never ending visas and work permits have to go home, and those that are",livejamie,SubredditDrama,Neutral,Immigration,"From Price Checks to Precedent: r/Walmart Debates Federal Immigration Policy ## Context/Backstory
In May 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration’s move to end TPS and humanitarian parole for migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Cuba. Over 500,000 people lost the legal protections that let them live and work in the U.S. practically overnight.

## Today's Discussion

Walmart is starting to enforce compliance, which means terminating staff who’ve worked there for years simply because their legal status was erased by policy.

[A screenshot is posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1l52259/evidentially_a_walmart_is_going_to_be_doing_this/) to /r/Walmart of an internal discussion about specific associates who are likely to be terminated.

## Some Choice Excerpts

### Why didn't your friend get their citizenship?

> Yes, we lost some too. Not their fault either as they've had their renewal in for months. They're just simply not being processed.
>> Yeah, my friend lost his job at another retail because his work permit wasn't renewed yet. Luckily he's gotten it now and got a new job, but it's ridiculous. Bro's been here since he was 5, this country is essentially all he knows. Just horrid.
>>> He has been on a permit for that long?
>>>> I'm honestly not too sure, I haven't ever asked point-blank about his citizenship lol. I know he was going to join the military a few years back, but wasn't able to due to changes DJT made to qualifications to join.
>>>> 
>>>> I'm gonna make a big assumption that he planned on being naturalized through joining and since they did away with that, he wasn't able to. I'm also gonna say this dude isn't the smartest and I'm not either so either one of us could be wrong in how I'm interpreting it lol.
>>>> 
>>>> ETA it may be more complicated than him having a green card for so long etc., I have another friend who married my friend that's a US citizen a couple years ago, but she still won't be a citizen for years and has to spend thousands to renew her green card every so often. Citizenship isn't very straightforward.
>>>>> Citizenship isn’t straightforward and that’s the problem. I’m not opposed to removing a shit ton of illegal immigrants but citizenship should have a very simple and straightforward path so that many of these illegal immigrants who honestly should be legal can become legal. For years I’ve said you can’t mass deport if you don’t make it accessible and easily understood how to become legal
>>>>>> You’re not wrong at all in that sentiment, unfortunately nobody in positions of power the past 30yrs have felt like fixing that issue.
>>>>>>> I was really expecting Obama to do it but I think between the DNC and the constant fighting back from the Republicans, he never made it happen

>>>> It ain’t exactly free. It’s not trumps million dollar golden pass but it cost a few hundreds to pay for the process. People born here take it for granted that we never had to pay or take a test most adults would fail. So I usually don’t judge people.

>>>>> It’s not a few hundreds. Just finished this process yesterday - from green card (conditional) to green card (non conditional) to citizenship for my spouse.

>>>>> Initial green card (2-years conditional status) Form I-130 $625 Form I-485 $1440

>>>>> Remove conditional status (10-year green card) Form I-751 $750

>>>>> Citizenship N-400 $710

>>>>> Fees alone - that’s $3,525.

>>>>> Add $2-3k for a lawyer throughout the process (didn’t use one for the N-400) and you’re looking at $5,500-$6,500.

>>>>>> This is why I said I don’t really judge people on it. The average American doesn’t know anything about the process and a lot of people really think it’s just a hop skip and a jump into a government office and you’re a citizen. It’s a lot, and this is perfect case scenario I’m guessing, with no Trump bs to interfere.

>> If he's been here that long, why hadn't he applied for citizenship?

>>> Who says he hadn’t? It’s not as easy and basic as applying for an apartment or car loan. It takes YEARS and can cost thousands. Not everybody has that kind of time or money.

>>>> You can also be deported or put on a list for just applying. Being illegal isn’t some easy ‘just work and don’t do crimes’ type of living like some people think. ICE vans literally raided several Hispanic neighborhoods in my old town yearly, deporting many hard working people who just want to live here and work.

>>>> There’s also language barriers, complexity of applying like you said, no government help to guide them, and no straight forward path.

>>> It's not always that easy. My friends mother took over 25 years to become a citizen, and not because of a lack of trying.

>> Dude there are people who have filed and have been waiting for insane lengths of time. Then there are people who finally get their hearings only to arrive, have their cases closed and visas revoked, then get detained immediately upon exiting the court room.

>> So fuck off.

>>> Yes, this is a new tactic the feds are using where they motion to dismiss a removal proceeding so that you walk out of the court then they arrest you again and put you in expedited removal which removes you from jurisdiction of the immigration court.

>>> If you have an attorney, you want to give them the heads up so they can motion against the dismissal of your removal if the government tries this.

>>> It sounds odd that the defense would motion to continue a removal proceeding, but it's better than ending up in expedited removal because it keeps the case in front of the court.

>>> The dismissal sounds like a good thing, but you actually don't want it because they'll be waiting for you in the lobby and you're going to get a much worse process than a removal proceeding in front of the court.

>> Been here since he was 5 and still won't even try to gain citizenship!? Time to go back to his homeland.

>>> Yeah I don't know why he didn't just scamper on over to the citizenship store and pick up a family pack.

### A discussion on ""illigals""

> What do they need to re-verify??

>> Eligibility to be employed in the United States. (Green card, visa or citizenship status)

>>> You mean so people who are here illigally cant work?

>>>> They are literally here legally if they’re impacted by this lmfao

### A manager chimes in and is shamed for their hiring practices

> We lost 32 ppl. All of my cart pushers, all of deli, and most of the ODP team. It’s bad.

>> So now what do they expect dude? I mean sure people might still shop and work there but for how much longer???? The store can only run on so many people efficiently and turnover rates are already outrageous. I hate working here

>>> What do you mean what are they gonna do? 😂 they are going to hire new people lol I think people fail to realize how many applicants we get at Walmart lol

---

>>> They will just hire US Citizens who are unemployed and need work...

>>>> To do jobs they already turned their nose up at? A lot of people are unemployed by choice, it's just not the ones you think it is

>>>>> They'll have to pay people a wage they will accept to do that job.

>>>>>> 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂 Wait….you don’t actually believe that do you? Walmart would rather close down then pay a livable wage.

>>>>> Then the parents of those unemployed people should kick them out. People shouldn’t just be sitting on their ass all day and night

>>>>>> Why have unemployed people living with their parents/friends when you can have homeless people on the streets instead lol

>>>>>>> Well why are they not working? Being a bum living with your parents is more bum behavior than being homeless, at least homeless people know how to hustle

>>>>>>>> Could be they apply for a job, and they give the job to people for will work for dollars less and don't speak English

>>>>>>>>> Walmart has standardized starting wages so that's a silly claim

>>> Honestly what I noticed is that all of the people at my store that were here from one of the banned countries, stayed here a long time and didn’t quit unlike a lot of American employees I’ve seen quit within a week. Also they were very hard workers and kind. I highly doubt it’s going to be easy to replace them. They gave us an amazing team and this is a devastating loss.

---

>>> Idk why ppl down voting . Its true. Hire ppl than can speak english. Just heard a store in miam lost 150 ppl. Im 100 % barely any of them spoke it And fail to assimilate. For reference. Im litertally half hispanic so i cant be racist since in non white according to librals/democrats.

>> Hire people with their I-9 documents instead of hiring illegal aliens and figuring nobody will ever do anything about it?

>>> I don't think you have been paying attention, but this isn't about illegal immigrants. I cannot understand for the life of me how people are not picking up on the fact that this is about people on work visas, people who ARE here legally and have been from the beginning. It's pretty much impossible for an undocumented (AKA ILLEGAL) immigrant to get a work visa from inside the US so it should be obvious it's not about them.

>>>> He’s maga… you think he understands the difference? They don’t get nuance or laws or facts lol.

>>>>> I actually voted for Harris and despise this administration.

>>> These were people who were legally working here until (by unconstitutional executive order) they suddenly didn't have the proper paper. These folks weren't the ones breaking the law here...

>>>> What legal status granted by the Immigration and Nationality Acts were they under?

>>>> Also, the Supreme Court said that it was legal for the Secretary of Homeland Security to rescind TPS. So that's the end of the line on that, and they ruled it was legal.

>>>>> You mean the Supreme Court that is following trump illegally and going against the constitution and the law as it’s written? We get it you’re MAGA, but he broke the law.

>>>>> But hey if you don’t care if you can go shop because a King decided a new law was allowed and his cronies allowed it to continue, more for you. Enjoy the higher prices, and slower lines. I look forward to your Karen video ranting about how slow Walmart is on YouTube.

>>>>>> If Ruth Bader Ginsburg had retired gracefully, then there'd be one less Republican on the Supreme Court.

>>>>>>She held on and died of cancer. This is what happens when you elevate a narcissist to sainthood when they screwed all of us.

>> Stores DO NOT hire undocumented people. Every single person hired is verified eligible to work. I worked HR for 2 years. What you stated is just 100% false.

---

>> Your lack of reading comprehension and basic understanding the difference between work visas vs ""illegal aliens"" is horrible.

>>> I've dealt with USCIS a lot. I know what I'm talking about.

>>>>Sure whatever you say random reddit user.

>> Only they were here legally

>>> That's actually not true.

>>> Item 1: The DHS canceled their TPS. The Supreme Court upheld this.

>>> Item 2: The printed expiration date on an EAD doesn't matter if USCIS canceled the card, the card is revoked immediately.

>>> Item 3: If they continue to work on an invalid EAD, it's not only a problem for Walmart, it's a problem for them. If they file another USCIS or ICE petition, they have to say YES that they have worked without authorization before.

>>> (Item 3 is only forgiven automatically for spouses of US citizens. It's still best to be able to answer NO.)

>>> Item 4: My spouse is a naturalized US citizen. I know a lot more than you do. We had to send thousands of pages to USCIS and pay a lot of expensive fees. I know a lot of their rules and regulations. You probably don't.

>>>> Key word is they were here legally before this know my team is gonna lose good workers.

### Another manager appears and this one deserves a spanking?

> My heart sank when I got this communication. I spoke to all 63 associates individually and made sure they knew I did not agree with this.

>> I can't imagine how gut-wrenching that was on a one on one basis

----

>> So you hired 63 people who didn't have I-9 documents and just turned a blind eye to it? How the hell did you have 63 people hired with no I-9 documents?

>> This deserves a spanking.

>> Everyone with legal permission to work should have something that proves it. This includes:

>> An Unrestricted Social Security Card (one that doesn't say Not Valid for work without DHS/INS Authorization) (The old ones said INS.)

>> A Real ID driver's license or State ID.

>> A US Passport or US Passport Card.

>> A Valid Unexpired Employment Authorization Document issued to legal immigrants by USCIS.

>> Various other documents that are all on the list, including some that INS last issued in the 1970s.

>> I hope that if you've knowingly looked the other way, that they fine your store millions of dollars, you deserve it. And if that's what happened, I think you deserve to be fired for this. That is beyond incompetent. This would be criminal.

>>> That’s not how it works. They MUST have a valid I-9 to work. The Walmart system will not hire them and process them if they do not. It’s their work permits & renewals that are not being processed by the Government so legally they are no longer allowed to work.

>>>>  Maybe this store manager should just quit breaking the law (if in fact they hired 63 people who lack work authorization, if in fact that is what happened here) and if they have trouble finding legal workers, they raise their wage.

>>>>  Businesses always try to figure out ways to be cheap and screw workers. When businesses hire unauthorized workers who will work for anything, that can be one way to accomplish that.

>>>>> You struggle with reading comprehension don’t you?

>>>>>> I also doubt any Walmart manager has a heart, much less that it sank unless they were contemplating having to raise wages to hire legal workers.

>>>>>> When I worked at Walmart, we had the nastiest store manager I think ever existed. We had her printing out threatening letters about people accidentally getting one minute over their schedule and taping them to the time clocks.

>>>>>> ""NO OVERTIME!!!! NOT ONE TICK!!!!""

### Not going after the criminals

> I thought dumbass was only going after ""criminals"" now he's just deporting people to hurt them.

>> Yes, this is the problem. They are simply snatching up non-citizens even with work visas and permits rejecting them. Yet it seeme to primarily affect persons of color. Many forget that we very much do have ""illegal aliens"" of European descent from Canada, France, England, etc. without citizenship here as well.

### A discussion on I-9 and the ""Rape Gangs"" of Haiti

> I-9 verification is important as it is there to make sure that jobs in the economy are given to US citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, people waiting to adjust their status who have an Employment Authorization Document, and various others who have a right to work in this country.

> It is very important to make sure that people who are not in the country legally are not working without authorization, especially during a downturn in the economy.

> The law has always said employers who knowingly or negligently hire people without authorization to work in the United States face fines and potentially other sanctions, but nobody enforced it.

> When this happens, wages are driven down and people who have the right to work have more trouble finding any job.

> HR people need to be very careful who they hire because this administration isn't screwing around anymore, and this is something I happen to agree with. If you have a right to work in this country, then you will have an I-9 document. If you don't have the I-9 document that was issued to you, you'd better get cracking on a replacement, if it's going to expire, you'd better get cracking on renewing it.

>> They are revoking their visas. Can't make it any clearer. They were here legally. They were working legally. Trump administration decided to revoke them to Make America Great Again. HIS WORDS. Over 300,000 workers lost their work visas in one swipe of a pen May 30th.

>> How do you guys miss this news? It's everywhere. Students are getting visas revoked from those countries too especially China.

>>> Yes, revoked status revokes the EAD too, which means you are employing these people illegally and they are working illegally as of the date the card was canceled, which may be well in advance of the printed date. It doesn't matter if they were here legally. They are not now. And if you continue to employ them, that's on you.

>>>> You know what. Fuck this attitude. They had the authorization to work, they were here under a protected status. They were doing everything they were supposed to do, but now they just get fucked because of the jackass in the white house. And then there's people like you tripping all over themselves to justify it. The President is fucking them over, and people like you are going along with it, but you want to act like it's the immigrants' fault.

>>>> This is nothing more than the banality of evil, someone hiding behind bureaucratic bullshit to justify pulling the rug out from under people who haven't done anything wrong.

>>>>> Exactly and this bozo trying his best to justify it when he didn't even have a clue bringing DACA in to it just proves it's happening right in front of people but they do not give a shit likely because they think they'll get more hours or something. I can't even with this shit. I saw my son's father taken years ago and he was a victim of child labor trafficking, after we'd been told he had a solid case. I have learned way more about immigration law than I ever wanted to, only to see the system kill his spirit, rob us of our family, and he's probably dead now considering how they left him when they dumped him in a country he didn't know AT ALL, just where he was born. Spanish wasn't even his first language and they just did not give a shit and nobody does if they have been conditioned to think immigrants are a net negative.

>>>>  Walmart is not USCIS or ICE. Walmart is not the Immigration Court. Walmart is not a federal court.

>>>> Walmart can only employ people who pass I-9 verification, that's the law.

>>>> If Walmart wants to break the law, there are fines. There are prisons.

>>>> Walmart is not going to pay fines or have its executives arrested, so guess what happens.

>>>>> Don't be obtuse jackass. I'm talking about their authorization revoked by USCIS and/or ICE per the President's instructions.

>>>>> For someone who ""dealt with USCIS a lot"" you should have been able to figure that out. But instead, you're going to act like you don't understand what I'm referring to. You're just playing dumb at this point. You keep carrying on about how Walmart can only employ people who pass i-9 verification, when the ENTIRE FUCKING POINT WAS THAT THEY DID RIGHT UP UNTIL THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO REVOKE THEIR AUTHORISATION. People keep pointing that out to you, but you completely fucking ignore it.

>>>> Also, the banality of evil was a book about how utterly normal the people behind the Holocaust were.

>>>> There's a big difference between ""The conditions that made you eligible for TPS no longer exist in your country, here's a plane ticket and $1,000 for you and every family member to go home now."" and the Holocaust.

>>>> You are committing Holocaust Inversion.

>>>> $1,000 for each member of the family doesn't sound like much but for most of these people, that goes quite a ways in their home country.

>>>> Most people in those countries don't earn $50 if they work for an entire month. So while it may sound like an insult to you, that's actually a lot of money in some of those countries. It'll get them back on their feet again when they land.

>>>>> Oh yeah, let's revoke the TPS status for people from fucking Haiti, because we know that country is just doing fucking great right now.

>>>>> Also you misunderstand the concept of the banality of evil, it wasn't just about how normal the people behind the holocaust were. It was also about how many people who committed evil acts, were not necessarily motivated by monstrous desires or impulses, but much more mundane or seemingly benign motivations like ""Just following orders,"" or ""just following the law.""

>>>>> And that's why I think it applies to you. You don't care that these people's lives are being upended. You don't care that they're getting fucked over by a capricious decision by the administration, because hey it's legal. So it's ok then.

>>>>>> I think Haiti's problem dates back to throwing out the French. And now instead of the French, it's the warlords and rape gangs fighting in the streets with mortars and AK-47s.

>>>>>>> Yeah, that is the problem. And now, the Haitians who have had their TPS status revoked, now get to go back to that. But hey, the President did it and the Supreme Court signed off on it, so everything is a-ok right? Sure, they might catch a bullet. A mortar might fall on their head, but they don't have valid documentation anymore clearly they have to go back right? Right.

>>>>>>>> I love CNN. Only CNN could describe warlords and rape gangs as ""armed men"".

>>>>>>>> Anyway, yeah Haiti is totally screwed up. The UN should be putting Peacekeepers there.

>>>>>>>> The optics of having European soldiers in Haiti would be more desirable than warlords and rape gangs. The UN is completely ineffectual.

>>>>>>>>> And none of what you just said addresses the singular point of, we're going to be sending people back to that.

>>>>>>>>> Instead you want to talk about what the UN should do. Well, they aren't fucking doing it, so what the UN is or isn't doing, is neither here nor there.

>>>>>>>>> We're sending them to the place that's run by gangs, and you seem to be alright with that, because hey, they don't have valid documentation. But hey, it's not all bad right, they can get $1000 dollars and some plane tickets.

>>>>>>>>>> They actually don't automatically get deported. They can of course apply for humanitarian or refugee status, and if they stay and get put into deportation proceedings, they have a right to ask for protection from removal from the Immigration Court.

>>>>>>>>>> There are still options, but TPS is not one of them.

>>>>>>>>>> If you want to help these people, tell them to go file for unemployment. They may actually get it since it's not their fault they lost their jobs.
>>>>>>>>>>> No, they actually won't get unemployment. You have to legally be able to work in order to qualify for unemployment.

>> You are completely wrong.

>> Not partially, but completely.

>> I'm dealing with this directly and the people I'm about to fire have EADs that are listed to be up to 330 days from now. They didn't forget to renew. A bunch of people have paperwork stating their new category EAD is coming in a couple of months. That doesn't matter to Trump.

>> What does matter is they came in under the humanitarian aid. Since they came in from a Biden act, Trump found an easy way to screw over non-whites and the Dems by going after a small subset of people. Small in this case being 500k or so people.

>> Completely wrong. Everything was legal and groovy till Trump wanted to be a fascist.

>>> I am actually not wrong.

>>> The date on the printed card is irrelevant if USCIS cancels the card. The card becomes invalid regardless.

>>> So yes, it's possible to have a card they issued yesterday and canceled today come up as not valid when you run it.

>>> When your status in the country that they issued the card under lapses, the card is junk. It's trash.

>>> This also happens to people who file for Green Cards if their I-485 is DENIED. The EAD expires immediately no matter what the expiration date is on the card.

>>> If you continue to work past the date the card is canceled, then it is VERY bad if you manage to file another petition with USCIS because you have to tell them YES when it asks if you have EVER worked without authorization.

>>> Unauthorized work question is only forgiven automatically for spouses of US citizens, and it's still not a good look.

>>>> Your first post was all about how it's bad to hire illegals and how it's very important to hire people with the right I-9 documents.

>>>> They got hired legally and with the proper documents.

>>>> Don't move the damn goalposts. You bitched about the legality of the initial hire and how they need to keep current on their documents. Everything was legal at the time and I'm seeing a lot of receipts for my workers paying the Government 1444$ to get a new card that would arrive literal months before their current EAD was set to expire.

>>>> What Trump did was legal. I know this. Legal doesn't mean moral, and these actions are all to screw over the immigrant population.

>>>>> When an EAD is canceled, it is invalid immediately, regardless of the printed date.

>>>>> If they had their petition terminated by USCIS or their TPS was canceled, and this leads to the EAD being revoked, if they continue working, that's illegal. Walmart has to re-verify them for PRECISELY this reason, you know.

>>>>> The employer has to get rid of them when it becomes aware they are not allowed to work.

>>>>> Apparently Walmart loaded up on Biden's peasants who would work for anything, to bust wages, and now your stores are losing 10-20% of their workers, I guess?

>>>>> Pardon me while I play the world's smallest violin for you.

>>>>> Well, sounds like a tough story. Maybe raise wages a few bucks and see if any Americans or Green Card holders need work. I do not know what else to tell you, bub.

>>>>>> So you want the people who are contributing to society to quit? Are you going to pick up their work?

>>>>>>> If they have a valid EAD and they want it to be processed on time, they need to file well ahead of time for a renewal using an I-765. Filing it online makes sure the application doesn't get lost in the mail.

>>>>>>> The post office is very unreliable and you can guarantee that it will at least add between 5-15 days in transit (especially with the cutbacks). There is also a slight chance it will get lost and then the EAD will expire and you will have no extension letter because that happened.

>>>>>>> Filing on paper will also get your application in a mail sorting room or on someone's desk for a while. USCIS and their contractors are laying off. Filing electronically skips the part where someone has to crack it open and feed it into a scanner.

>>>>>>> Once the system recognizes the filing, you will get a receipt notice telling you that your EAD has been extended. As of the last time I checked, many are being extended for 2-4 years, so you need to have that receipt and the expired EAD, otherwise you cannot verify and you will lose your job.

>>>>>>> I do not want even one person who has a legal right to work in the United States to lose their job just because of paperwork. If you have a right to an EAD card, you need to be proactive in renewing it in time to at least have the extension letter and the expired EAD in hand when your employer says you need to recertify.

>>>>>>> Filing immigration benefits, is turning into the same situation as tax filings. People who still insist on paper find that their tax filing may be sitting on someone's desk unopened two or three years later. You should NEVER file ANYTHING with USCIS on paper unless that petition has no electronic option. It's not a good idea. It will just gum everything up.

>>>>>>> If you owe a fee, it can also be difficult to find the correct fee on the schedule if you file with paper, and the fee will be higher. Anything sent in with the wrong fee risks having the entire packet rejected, often after months. Electronic forms have you pay the correct fees, always.

>>>>>>>> You keep going on about valid EADs but you are keeping out the part where it was valid until Trump said it wasn't and people aren't being given time to renew theirs. But something tells me that I am talking to a brick wall.

>>>>>>>> Is America great yet? How come the richest country in the world not be able to support illegal immigrants? Could it be that America isn't as Great as people make it seem?

>>>>>>>>> It does not really matter why they're not valid if they're not valid and there's no way to get a valid EAD again. You can talk to an attorney if you think it will help or there's some other legal reason for being here, but they don't make the laws, they can only help explain them to you and make your case if you have one.

>>>>>>>>> I'm not saying it's right. I'm not making a moral judgment here. The law says the President gives TPS and the President takes it away. If you're a citizen and don't like what's going on in our country, and it bothers you this much, go vote.

>>>>>>>>> Go vote a ballot.

>>>>>>>>> We live in a country where a lot of people complain but nobody stops things like this from happening, by picking up a ballot, filling it out, and dropping it in the box.

>>>>>>>>> So now we have a crazy racist old lunatic that's destroying our economy, who was put there by religious extremists and other idiots. That's what happens when people won't spend five minutes voting. (Other than those people.)

>>>>>>>>>> I did vote. I voted against this.

>>>>>>>>>> Trump isn't even catching any actual illegal immigrants. The ones that are getting deported already are in the system. Some even had pending court cases to get permanent residency status. He's going after the easy ones.

>>>>>>>>>>> If you have a pending I-485 and you have a criminal record, expect ICE to be at your USCIS appointment.

>> How do i explain this to you without using crayons...

>> These employees came into the country LEGALLY. They got the paperwork approved. They did everything correctly. They were doing good.

>> Then Trump signed papers with his tiny hands REVOKING their citizenship overnight without cause.

>> This made the people who came into our country the legal way have their visas and papers absolutely worthless in an instant despite them having done no crimes.

>> Walmart, who checks visa and shit before hiring them, suddenly had to reverify to comply with our shitty hitler.

>> Nod if you understand. I am prepared to whip out crayons for you if needed.

>>> Actually Kristi Noem signed the papers.

>>> TPS is not a legal status. It's something the President can use to admit people who don't qualify to be admitted. (Yes, I know that statement does not seem to be logical, but this is often how the INA works.)

>>> If they can re-verify their (now) expired EADs, they get to keep their jobs. If they can't, then they have to be let go because they are NO LONGER in the country with ANY status or program.

### Apparently some of them are bad workers

> It's true, and incredibly sad & frustrating. Good people are losing their jobs because the Trump Administration is obsessed with taking away people's civil liberties.

> Now they think America doesn't want them, and they don't feel safe returning to their country full of internal strife.

>> Lol the ppl that got fired were here 6 months and could barely work 1 pallet of detergant in chemicals, or take all night in paper. Pretty much milk everything. If they do finsh they get mad when their sent to other departments. Like its your job.

### Don't come here illegally

> ok then don’t come here illegally

>> They didn’t. They were here legally until Trump revoked their TPS designation and SCOTUS just upheld his right to do so. They were legally here until like, last week.

### The same conversation again

> It’s almost like you need to have documentation to be able to work in the United States, idk man

>> It’s almost like the stacked Supreme Court just flushed a bunch of documentation down the drain, rug pulling folks who were perfectly legal to work up until that point.


>>> It was voted 7-2 which means even one of the judges considered liberal supported it.

>> THEY HAD DOCUMENTATION.

>> Would it really be so hard to keep up with important news in our country?

---

>> It's almost like they DO though. We get it, reading is hard

In May 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration’s move to end TPS and humanitarian parole for migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Cuba. Over 500,000 people lost the legal protections that let them live and work in the U.S. practically overnight.

## Today's Discussion

 is starting to enforce compliance, which means terminating staff who’ve worked there for years simply because their legal status was erased by policy.

[A screenshot is posted](https://old.reddit.com/r//comments/1l52259/evidentially_a_walmart_is_going_to_be_doing_this/) to /r/ of an internal discussion about specific associates who are likely to be terminated.

## Some Choice Excerpts

### Why didn't your friend get their citizenship?

> Yes, we lost some too. Not their fault either as they've had their renewal in for months. They're just simply not being processed.
>> Yeah, my friend lost his job at another retail because his work permit wasn't renewed yet. Luckily he's gotten it now and got a new job, but it's ridiculous. Bro's been here since he was 5, this country is essentially all he knows. Just horrid.
>>> He has been on a permit for that long?
>>>> I'm honestly not too sure, I haven't ever asked point-blank about his citizenship lol. I know he was going to join the military a few years back, but wasn't able to due to changes DJT made to qualifications to join.
>>>> 
>>>> I'm gonna make a big assumption that he planned on being naturalized through joining and since they did away with that, he wasn't able to. I'm also gonna say this dude isn't the smartest and I'm not either so either one of us could be wrong in how I'm interpreting it lol.
>>>> 
>>>> ETA it may be more complicated than him having a green  for so long etc., I have another friend who married my friend that's a US citizen a couple years ago, but she still won't be a citizen for years and has to spend thousands to renew her green  every so often. Citizenship isn't very straightforward.
>>>>> Citizenship isn’t straightforward and that’s the problem. I’m not opposed to removing a shit ton of   but citizenship should have a very simple and straightforward path so that many of these   who honestly should be legal can become legal. For years I’ve said you can’t mass deport if you don’t make it accessible and easily understood how to become legal
>>>>>> You’re not wrong at all in that sentiment, unfortunately nobody in positions of power the past 30yrs have felt like fixing that issue.
>>>>>>> I was really expecting Obama to do it but I think between the DNC and the constant fighting back from the Republicans, he never made it happen

>>>> It ain’t exactly free. It’s not trumps million dollar golden pass but it cost a few hundreds to pay for the process. People  here take it for granted that we never had to pay or take a test most adults would fail. So I usually don’t judge people.

>>>>> It’s not a few hundreds. Just finished this process yesterday - from green  (conditional) to green  (non conditional) to citizenship for my spouse.

>>>>> Initial green  (2-years conditional status) Form I-130 $625 Form I-485 $1440

>>>>> Remove conditional status (10-year green ) Form I-751 $750

>>>>> Citizenship N-400 $710

>>>>> Fees alone - that’s $3,525.

>>>>> Add $2-3k for a lawyer throughout the process (didn’t use one for the N-400) and you’re looking at $5,500-$6,500.

>>>>>> This is why I said I don’t really judge people on it. The average American doesn’t know anything about the process and a lot of people really think it’s just a hop skip and a jump into a government office and you’re a citizen. It’s a lot, and this is perfect case scenario I’m guessing, with no Trump bs to interfere.

>> If he's been here that long, why hadn't he applied for citizenship?

>>> Who says he hadn’t? It’s not as easy and basic as applying for an apartment or car loan. It takes YEARS and can cost thousands. Not everybody has that kind of time or money.

>>>> You can also be deported or put on a list for just applying. Being  isn’t some easy ‘just work and don’t do crimes’ type of living like some people think. ICE vans literally raided several Hispanic neighborhoods in my old town yearly, deporting many hard working people who just want to live here and work.

>>>> There’s also language barriers, complexity of applying like you said, no government help to guide them, and no straight forward path.

>>> It's not always that easy. My friends mother took over 25 years to become a citizen, and not because of a lack of trying.

>> Dude there are people who have filed and have been waiting for insane lengths of time. Then there are people who finally get their hearings only to arrive, have their cases closed and visas revoked, then get detained immediately upon exiting the court room.

>> So fuck off.

>>> Yes, this is a new tactic the feds are using where they motion to dismiss a removal proceeding so that you walk out of the court then they arrest you again and put you in expedited removal which removes you from jurisdiction of the immigration court.

>>> If you have an attorney, you want to give them the heads up so they can motion against the dismissal of your removal if the government tries this.

>>> It sounds odd that the defense would motion to continue a removal proceeding, but it's better than ending up in expedited removal because it keeps the case in front of the court.

>>> The dismissal sounds like a good thing, but you actually don't want it because they'll be waiting for you in the lobby and you're going to get a much worse process than a removal proceeding in front of the court.

>> Been here since he was 5 and still won't even try to gain citizenship!? Time to go back to his homeland.

>>> Yeah I don't know why he didn't just scamper on over to the citizenship store and pick up a family pack.

### A discussion on ""illigals""

> What do they need to re-verify??

>> Eligibility to be employed in the United States. (Green , visa or citizenship status)

>>> You mean so people who are here illigally cant work?

>>>> They are literally here legally if they’re impacted by this lmfao

### A manager chimes in and is shamed for their hiring practices

> We lost 32 ppl. All of my cart pushers, all of deli, and most of the ODP team. It’s bad.

>> So now what do they expect dude? I mean sure people might still shop and work there but for how much longer???? The store can only run on so many people efficiently and turnover rates are already outrageous. I hate working here

>>> What do you mean what are they gonna do? 😂 they are going to hire new people lol I think people fail to realize how many applicants we get at  lol

---

>>> They will just hire US Citizens who are unemployed and need work...

>>>> To do jobs they already turned their nose up at? A lot of people are unemployed by choice, it's just not the ones you think it is

>>>>> They'll have to pay people a wage they will accept to do that job.

>>>>>> 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂 Wait….you don’t actually believe that do you?  would rather close down then pay a livable wage.

>>>>> Then the parents of those unemployed people should kick them out. People shouldn’t just be sitting on their ass all day and night

>>>>>> Why have unemployed people living with their parents/friends when you can have homeless people on the streets instead lol

>>>>>>> Well why are they not working? Being a bum living with your parents is more bum behavior than being homeless, at least homeless people know how to hustle

>>>>>>>> Could be they apply for a job, and they give the job to people for will work for dollars less and don't speak English

>>>>>>>>>  has standardized starting wages so that's a silly claim

>>> Honestly what I noticed is that all of the people at my store that were here from one of the banned countries, stayed here a long time and didn’t quit unlike a lot of American employees I’ve seen quit within a week. Also they were very hard workers and kind. I highly doubt it’s going to be easy to replace them. They gave us an amazing team and this is a devastating loss.

---

>>> Idk why ppl down voting . Its true. Hire ppl than can speak english. Just heard a store in miam lost 150 ppl. Im 100 % barely any of them spoke it And fail to assimilate. For reference. Im litertally half hispanic so i cant be racist since in non white according to librals/democrats.

>> Hire people with their I-9 documents instead of hiring  aliens and figuring nobody will ever do anything about it?

>>> I don't think you have been paying attention, but this isn't about  . I cannot understand for the life of me how people are not picking up on the fact that this is about people on work visas, people who ARE here legally and have been from the beginning. It's pretty much impossible for an undocumented (AKA ) immigrant to get a work visa from inside the US so it should be obvious it's not about them.

>>>> He’s maga… you think he understands the difference? They don’t get nuance or laws or facts lol.

>>>>> I actually voted for Harris and despise this administration.

>>> These were people who were legally working here until (by unconstitutional executive order) they suddenly didn't have the proper paper. These folks weren't the ones breaking the law here...

>>>> What legal status granted by the Immigration and Nationality Acts were they under?

>>>> Also, the Supreme Court said that it was legal for the Secretary of Homeland Security to rescind TPS. So that's the end of the line on that, and they ruled it was legal.

>>>>> You mean the Supreme Court that is following trump illegally and going against the constitution and the law as it’s written? We get it you’re MAGA, but he broke the law.

>>>>> But hey if you don’t care if you can go shop because a King decided a new law was allowed and his cronies allowed it to continue, more for you. Enjoy the higher prices, and slower lines. I look forward to your Karen video ranting about how slow  is on YouTube.

>>>>>> If Ruth Bader Ginsburg had retired gracefully, then there'd be one less Republican on the Supreme Court.

>>>>>>She held on and died of cancer. This is what happens when you elevate a narcissist to sainthood when they screwed all of us.

>> Stores DO NOT hire undocumented people. Every single person hired is verified eligible to work. I worked HR for 2 years. What you stated is just 100% false.

---

>> Your lack of reading comprehension and basic understanding the difference between work visas vs "" aliens"" is horrible.

>>> I've dealt with USCIS a lot. I know what I'm talking about.

>>>>Sure whatever you say random reddit user.

>> Only they were here legally

>>> That's actually not true.

>>> Item 1: The DHS canceled their TPS. The Supreme Court upheld this.

>>> Item 2: The printed expiration date on an EAD doesn't matter if USCIS canceled the , the  is revoked immediately.

>>> Item 3: If they continue to work on an invalid EAD, it's not only a problem for , it's a problem for them. If they file another USCIS or ICE petition, they have to say YES that they have worked without authorization before.

>>> (Item 3 is only forgiven automatically for spouses of US citizens. It's still best to be able to answer NO.)

>>> Item 4: My spouse is a naturalized US citizen. I know a lot more than you do. We had to send thousands of pages to USCIS and pay a lot of expensive fees. I know a lot of their rules and regulations. You probably don't.

>>>> Key word is they were here legally before this know my team is gonna lose good workers.

### Another manager appears and this one deserves a spanking?

> My heart sank when I got this communication. I spoke to all 63 associates individually and made sure they knew I did not agree with this.

>> I can't imagine how gut-wrenching that was on a one on one basis

----

>> So you hired 63 people who didn't have I-9 documents and just turned a blind eye to it? How the hell did you have 63 people hired with no I-9 documents?

>> This deserves a spanking.

>> Everyone with legal permission to work should have something that proves it. This includes:

>> An Unrestricted Social Security  (one that doesn't say Not Valid for work without DHS/INS Authorization) (The old ones said INS.)

>> A Real ID driver's license or State ID.

>> A US Passport or US Passport .

>> A Valid Unexpired Employment Authorization Document issued to legal  by USCIS.

>> Various other documents that are all on the list, including some that INS last issued in the 1970s.

>> I hope that if you've knowingly looked the other way, that they fine your store millions of dollars, you deserve it. And if that's what happened, I think you deserve to be fired for this. That is beyond incompetent. This would be criminal.

>>> That’s not how it works. They MUST have a valid I-9 to work. The  system will not hire them and process them if they do not. It’s their work permits & renewals that are not being processed by the Government so legally they are no longer allowed to work.

>>>>  Maybe this store manager should just quit breaking the law (if in fact they hired 63 people who lack work authorization, if in fact that is what happened here) and if they have trouble finding legal workers, they raise their wage.

>>>>  Businesses always try to figure out ways to be cheap and screw workers. When businesses hire unauthorized workers who will work for anything, that can be one way to accomplish that.

>>>>> You struggle with reading comprehension don’t you?

>>>>>> I also doubt any  manager has a heart, much less that it sank unless they were contemplating having to raise wages to hire legal workers.

>>>>>> When I worked at , we had the nastiest store manager I think ever existed. We had her printing out threatening letters about people accidentally getting one minute over their schedule and taping them to the time clocks.

>>>>>> ""NO OVERTIME!!!! NOT ONE TICK!!!!""

### Not going after the criminals

> I thought dumbass was only going after ""criminals"" now he's just deporting people to hurt them.

>> Yes, this is the problem. They are simply snatching up non-citizens even with work visas and permits rejecting them. Yet it seeme to primarily affect persons of color. Many forget that we very much do have "" aliens"" of European descent from Canada, France, England, etc. without citizenship here as well.

### A discussion on I-9 and the ""Rape Gangs"" of Haiti

> I-9 verification is important as it is there to make sure that jobs in the economy are given to US citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, people waiting to adjust their status who have an Employment Authorization Document, and various others who have a  to work in this country.

> It is very important to make sure that people who are not in the country legally are not working without authorization, especially during a downturn in the economy.

> The law has always said employers who knowingly or negligently hire people without authorization to work in the United States face fines and potentially other sanctions, but nobody enforced it.

> When this happens, wages are driven down and people who have the  to work have more trouble finding any job.

> HR people need to be very careful who they hire because this administration isn't screwing around anymore, and this is something I happen to agree with. If you have a  to work in this country, then you will have an I-9 document. If you don't have the I-9 document that was issued to you, you'd better get cracking on a replacement, if it's going to expire, you'd better get cracking on renewing it.

>> They are revoking their visas. Can't make it any clearer. They were here legally. They were working legally. Trump administration decided to revoke them to Make America Great Again. HIS WORDS. Over 300,000 workers lost their work visas in one swipe of a pen May 30th.

>> How do you guys miss this news? It's everywhere. Students are getting visas revoked from those countries too especially .

>>> Yes, revoked status revokes the EAD too, which means you are employing these people illegally and they are working illegally as of the date the  was canceled, which may be well in advance of the printed date. It doesn't matter if they were here legally. They are not now. And if you continue to employ them, that's on you.

>>>> You know what. Fuck this attitude. They had the authorization to work, they were here under a protected status. They were doing everything they were supposed to do, but now they just get fucked because of the jackass in the white house. And then there's people like you tripping all over themselves to justify it. The  is fucking them over, and people like you are going along with it, but you want to act like it's the ' fault.

>>>> This is nothing more than the banality of evil, someone hiding behind bureaucratic bullshit to justify pulling the rug out from under people who haven't done anything wrong.

>>>>> Exactly and this bozo trying his best to justify it when he didn't even have a clue bringing DACA in to it just proves it's happening  in front of people but they do not give a shit likely because they think they'll get more hours or something. I can't even with this shit. I saw my son's father taken years ago and he was a victim of child labor trafficking, after we'd been told he had a solid case. I have learned way more about immigration law than I ever wanted to, only to see the system kill his spirit, rob us of our family, and he's probably dead now considering how they left him when they dumped him in a country he didn't know AT ALL, just where he was . Spanish wasn't even his first language and they just did not give a shit and nobody does if they have been conditioned to think  are a net negative.

>>>>   is not USCIS or ICE.  is not the Immigration Court.  is not a federal court.

>>>>  can only employ people who pass I-9 verification, that's the law.

>>>> If  wants to break the law, there are fines. There are prisons.

>>>>  is not going to pay fines or have its executives arrested, so guess what happens.

>>>>> Don't be obtuse jackass. I'm talking about their authorization revoked by USCIS and/or ICE per the 's instructions.

>>>>> For someone who ""dealt with USCIS a lot"" you should have been able to figure that out. But instead, you're going to act like you don't understand what I'm referring to. You're just playing dumb at this point. You keep carrying on about how  can only employ people who pass i-9 verification, when the ENTIRE FUCKING POINT WAS THAT THEY DID  UP UNTIL THE  DECIDED TO REVOKE THEIR AUTHORISATION. People keep pointing that out to you, but you completely fucking ignore it.

>>>> Also, the banality of evil was a book about how utterly normal the people behind the Holocaust were.

>>>> There's a big difference between ""The conditions that made you eligible for TPS no longer exist in your country, here's a plane ticket and $1,000 for you and every family member to go home now."" and the Holocaust.

>>>> You are committing Holocaust Inversion.

>>>> $1,000 for each member of the family doesn't sound like much but for most of these people, that goes quite a ways in their home country.

>>>> Most people in those countries don't earn $50 if they work for an entire month. So while it may sound like an insult to you, that's actually a lot of money in some of those countries. It'll get them back on their feet again when they land.

>>>>> Oh yeah, let's revoke the TPS status for people from fucking Haiti, because we know that country is just doing fucking great  now.

>>>>> Also you misunderstand the concept of the banality of evil, it wasn't just about how normal the people behind the holocaust were. It was also about how many people who committed evil acts, were not necessarily motivated by monstrous desires or impulses, but much more mundane or seemingly benign motivations like ""Just following orders,"" or ""just following the law.""

>>>>> And that's why I think it applies to you. You don't care that these people's lives are being upended. You don't care that they're getting fucked over by a capricious decision by the administration, because hey it's legal. So it's ok then.

>>>>>> I think Haiti's problem dates back to throwing out the French. And now instead of the French, it's the warlords and rape gangs fighting in the streets with mortars and AK-47s.

>>>>>>> Yeah, that is the problem. And now, the Haitians who have had their TPS status revoked, now get to go back to that. But hey, the  did it and the Supreme Court signed off on it, so everything is a-ok ? Sure, they might catch a bullet. A mortar might fall on their head, but they don't have valid documentation anymore clearly they have to go back ? .

>>>>>>>> I love CNN. Only CNN could describe warlords and rape gangs as ""armed men"".

>>>>>>>> Anyway, yeah Haiti is totally screwed up. The UN should be putting Peacekeepers there.

>>>>>>>> The optics of having European soldiers in Haiti would be more desirable than warlords and rape gangs. The UN is completely ineffectual.

>>>>>>>>> And none of what you just said addresses the singular point of, we're going to be sending people back to that.

>>>>>>>>> Instead you want to talk about what the UN should do. Well, they aren't fucking doing it, so what the UN is or isn't doing, is neither here nor there.

>>>>>>>>> We're sending them to the place that's run by gangs, and you seem to be alright with that, because hey, they don't have valid documentation. But hey, it's not all bad , they can get $1000 dollars and some plane tickets.

>>>>>>>>>> They actually don't automatically get deported. They can of course apply for humanitarian or refugee status, and if they stay and get put into deportation proceedings, they have a  to ask for protection from removal from the Immigration Court.

>>>>>>>>>> There are still options, but TPS is not one of them.

>>>>>>>>>> If you want to help these people, tell them to go file for unemployment. They may actually get it since it's not their fault they lost their jobs.
>>>>>>>>>>> No, they actually won't get unemployment. You have to legally be able to work in order to qualify for unemployment.

>> You are completely wrong.

>> Not partially, but completely.

>> I'm dealing with this directly and the people I'm about to fire have EADs that are listed to be up to 330 days from now. They didn't forget to renew. A bunch of people have paperwork stating their new category EAD is coming in a couple of months. That doesn't matter to Trump.

>> What does matter is they came in under the humanitarian aid. Since they came in from a Biden act, Trump found an easy way to screw over non-whites and the Dems by going after a small subset of people. Small in this case being 500k or so people.

>> Completely wrong. Everything was legal and groovy till Trump wanted to be a fascist.

>>> I am actually not wrong.

>>> The date on the printed  is irrelevant if USCIS cancels the . The  becomes invalid regardless.

>>> So yes, it's possible to have a  they issued yesterday and canceled today come up as not valid when you run it.

>>> When your status in the country that they issued the  under lapses, the  is junk. It's trash.

>>> This also happens to people who file for Green Cards if their I-485 is DENIED. The EAD expires immediately no matter what the expiration date is on the .

>>> If you continue to work past the date the  is canceled, then it is VERY bad if you manage to file another petition with USCIS because you have to tell them YES when it asks if you have EVER worked without authorization.

>>> Unauthorized work question is only forgiven automatically for spouses of US citizens, and it's still not a good look.

>>>> Your first post was all about how it's bad to hire illegals and how it's very important to hire people with the  I-9 documents.

>>>> They got hired legally and with the proper documents.

>>>> Don't move the damn goalposts. You bitched about the legality of the initial hire and how they need to keep current on their documents. Everything was legal at the time and I'm seeing a lot of receipts for my workers paying the Government 1444$ to get a new  that would arrive literal months before their current EAD was set to expire.

>>>> What Trump did was legal. I know this. Legal doesn't mean moral, and these actions are all to screw over the immigrant population.

>>>>> When an EAD is canceled, it is invalid immediately, regardless of the printed date.

>>>>> If they had their petition terminated by USCIS or their TPS was canceled, and this leads to the EAD being revoked, if they continue working, that's .  has to re-verify them for PRECISELY this reason, you know.

>>>>> The employer has to get rid of them when it becomes aware they are not allowed to work.

>>>>> Apparently  loaded up on Biden's peasants who would work for anything, to bust wages, and now your stores are losing 10-20% of their workers, I guess?

>>>>> Pardon me while I play the world's smallest violin for you.

>>>>> Well, sounds like a tough story. Maybe raise wages a few bucks and see if any Americans or Green  holders need work. I do not know what else to tell you, bub.

>>>>>> So you want the people who are contributing to society to quit? Are you going to pick up their work?

>>>>>>> If they have a valid EAD and they want it to be processed on time, they need to file well ahead of time for a renewal using an I-765. Filing it online makes sure the application doesn't get lost in the mail.

>>>>>>> The post office is very unreliable and you can guarantee that it will at least add between 5-15 days in transit (especially with the cutbacks). There is also a slight chance it will get lost and then the EAD will expire and you will have no extension letter because that happened.

>>>>>>> Filing on paper will also get your application in a mail sorting room or on someone's desk for a while. USCIS and their contractors are laying off. Filing electronically skips the part where someone has to crack it open and feed it into a scanner.

>>>>>>> Once the system recognizes the filing, you will get a receipt notice telling you that your EAD has been extended. As of the last time I checked, many are being extended for 2-4 years, so you need to have that receipt and the expired EAD, otherwise you cannot verify and you will lose your job.

>>>>>>> I do not want even one person who has a legal  to work in the United States to lose their job just because of paperwork. If you have a  to an EAD , you need to be proactive in renewing it in time to at least have the extension letter and the expired EAD in hand when your employer says you need to recertify.

>>>>>>> Filing immigration benefits, is turning into the same situation as tax filings. People who still insist on paper find that their tax filing may be sitting on someone's desk unopened two or three years later. You should NEVER file ANYTHING with USCIS on paper unless that petition has no electronic option. It's not a good idea. It will just gum everything up.

>>>>>>> If you owe a fee, it can also be difficult to find the correct fee on the schedule if you file with paper, and the fee will be higher. Anything sent in with the wrong fee risks having the entire packet rejected, often after months. Electronic forms have you pay the correct fees, always.

>>>>>>>> You keep going on about valid EADs but you are keeping out the part where it was valid until Trump said it wasn't and people aren't being given time to renew theirs. But something tells me that I am talking to a brick wall.

>>>>>>>> Is America great yet? How come the richest country in the world not be able to support  ? Could it be that America isn't as Great as people make it seem?

>>>>>>>>> It does not really matter why they're not valid if they're not valid and there's no way to get a valid EAD again. You can talk to an attorney if you think it will help or there's some other legal reason for being here, but they don't make the laws, they can only help explain them to you and make your case if you have one.

>>>>>>>>> I'm not saying it's . I'm not making a moral judgment here. The law says the  gives TPS and the  takes it away. If you're a citizen and don't like what's going on in our country, and it bothers you this much, go vote.

>>>>>>>>> Go vote a ballot.

>>>>>>>>> We live in a country where a lot of people complain but nobody stops things like this from happening, by picking up a ballot, filling it out, and dropping it in the box.

>>>>>>>>> So now we have a crazy racist old lunatic that's destroying our economy, who was put there by religious extremists and other idiots. That's what happens when people won't spend five minutes voting. (Other than those people.)

>>>>>>>>>> I did vote. I voted against this.

>>>>>>>>>> Trump isn't even catching any actual  . The ones that are getting deported already are in the system. Some even had pending court cases to get permanent residency status. He's going after the easy ones.

>>>>>>>>>>> If you have a pending I-485 and you have a criminal record, expect ICE to be at your USCIS appointment.

>> How do i explain this to you without using crayons...

>> These employees came into the country LEGALLY. They got the paperwork approved. They did everything correctly. They were doing good.

>> Then Trump signed papers with his tiny hands REVOKING their citizenship overnight without cause.

>> This made the people who came into our country the legal way have their visas and papers absolutely worthless in an instant despite them having done no crimes.

>> , who checks visa and shit before hiring them, suddenly had to reverify to comply with our shitty hitler.

>> Nod if you understand. I am prepared to whip out crayons for you if needed.

>>> Actually Kristi Noem signed the papers.

>>> TPS is not a legal status. It's something the  can use to admit people who don't qualify to be admitted. (Yes, I know that statement does not seem to be logical, but this is often how the INA works.)

>>> If they can re-verify their (now) expired EADs, they get to keep their jobs. If they can't, then they have to be let go because they are NO LONGER in the country with ANY status or program.

### Apparently some of them are bad workers

> It's true, and incredibly sad & frustrating. Good people are losing their jobs because the Trump Administration is obsessed with taking away people's civil liberties.

> Now they think America doesn't want them, and they don't feel safe returning to their country full of internal strife.

>> Lol the ppl that got fired were here 6 months and could barely work 1 pallet of detergant in chemicals, or take all night in paper. Pretty much milk everything. If they do finsh they get mad when their sent to other departments. Like its your job.

### Don't come here illegally

> ok then don’t come here illegally

>> They didn’t. They were here legally until Trump revoked their TPS designation and SCOTUS just upheld his  to do so. They were legally here until like, last week.

### The same conversation again

> It’s almost like you need to have documentation to be able to work in the United States, idk man

>> It’s almost like the stacked Supreme Court just flushed a bunch of documentation down the drain, rug pulling folks who were perfectly legal to work up until that point.


>>> It was voted 7-2 which means even one of the judges considered liberal supported it.

>> THEY HAD DOCUMENTATION.

>> Would it really be so hard to keep up with important news in our country?

---

>> It's almost like they DO though. We get it, reading is hard

https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1kvbbed/so_i_hear_youre_struggling_with_planned_economies/,Easy immigration helps the economy,So I Hear You're Struggling With Planned Economies (A Very General Planned Economy Guide/Tips),"With the 3.1 changes effect budget and what counts as a planned economy, so I've decided to make a (very general) guide on planned economies to help a few people I've seen struggling w/ it. Yugoslavia runs referring to any run where you get ATO and CSP aid. Also obviously trying for all green regions. Obivously this is general and if you want to aim for specific synergies check out [Catsland's synergy sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hwfuly/all_sordland_synergies_by_catsland_309_updated/). This will *not* cover emergency planned eco routes because they behave very differently.

---

**The Prologue:**

*All Routes:* Economics Degree is king, because it gives you 1 ED, law is useless and you can get OMEC expulsion even if you join the CSP w/o the history degree. Also means the 1ED can bring you to the higher trade war threshold

---

**Turn 1:**

*Dictatorship/Reformist/6&7 Routes:* Always do the railroad w/ SSC, Angland is super easy to recover and railroad has better synergies

*Yugoslavia Runs:* Sacrifice railroad for military funding, which I assume you will do because, well, why else would you do the Yugoslavia strategy

---

**Turn 2:**

*All Routes:* You're going to always want to do stimulus checks, PO and no ED loss are huge. For all routes you don't oppress the Bluds on, also sign the tourism act for free economy. Skipping this gets you a weaker economy but can still recover you at the end for more freedom, but business bailouts will lock you to mixed to my knowledge

---
**Turn 3:**

*All Routes:* Always do full GASOM investment for maximum profit. You have zero reason to sign the GREEN act really and it hits your economy. Also never ban both youth groups (hurts ED too much) but one or the other is fine.

When it comes to ministry funding your ED takes a hit for defunding (anything) but I typically do either all ministries funded or everything funded by the military (which I either maintain or defund). Just note that with Vagsland as an ally a mantained military can win through modernization, remove conscription, Iosef's pincer, and taking the Dome. 

*Dictatorship/Reformist/Yugoslavia:* 20% EPA is the only viable way to get planned economy at the end

*6&7 Routes:* Here you can actually go for 49% EPA, because reversing to 10% later *does* get you enough ""planned economy points"" to end with planned economy. Otherwise it won't work.

---
**Turn 4:**

*All Routes:* You're gonna always want to end at -7 or -8, depending on what word the economy is angrily yelling at you (STABLE and GROWING typically are fine at -8 at the school meeting, UNSTABLE and DANGER typically -7). 

Always do your infrastructure on time, you lose ED for delays. Also always do the research option to synergize w/ Bergia (hardest region to recover). Don't privatize education (duh). With the above in mind you can either sacrifice some things earlier OR raise taxes on small medium and large businesses for +5 budget. 

*Dictatorship/Reformist/Yugoslavia:* Invest in Lorren, both to avoid the energy crisis and for future synergies

*6&7 Routes:* Since you're at 49% you can skip Lorren investment, BUT well, you'll presumably revert back to 10% so in this *very specific* scenario you're going to want to do RI in Angland (yeah yeah shocking)

---

**Turn 5:**

*All Routes:* Always keep relaxed immigration imo, otherwise Angland will be a pain in the bum to recover. You're going to want to take the bad Agnolia deal and the negotiated down Welhen deal (you *could* do full OBT but it adds no extra economic benefit)

*Dictatorship/Reformist/6&7:* Accept UC aid, obviously. 

*Dictatorship Routes Only:* *If* you want to restrict immigration, then this route lets you relocate doctors to get you recover even with that, assuming you trade with Agnolia.

*Yugoslavia Routes:* Accept Arcasian aid, obviously

---

**Turn 6:**

*All Routes:* Keep healthcare public, always sell 2/3rds sales for maximum gain (+2 if 20%, +4 if 49%). Teach solely evolution (helps with some synergies, mandatory evolution but optional creationism might also work). Build rural schools and improve rural healthcare.

Partially related to the economy but always go with Nia's plan on 6&7 or your preferred route on other runs. If you have both USP wings on your side you can side with PFJP or NFP at the Victory Day meeting OR you can side with the NFP if you didn't because, for whatever reason, it consistently gets the assembly to centralize Bergia if you send it to them. This is mostly to save a decree slot.

*Dictatorship/Reformist/6&7:* So you have two main paths here, Sarna or Conriat Industrial Zone. 

Sarna will always be the easiest because the UC aid will get you high production with no additional investment. If your autonomous then, if the Catsland spreadsheet is right, you can skip Sarna and get green Bergia though Welhen trade, agricultural expansion, the minority rights act, and autonomy. Also CBRA isn't needed usually so you can veto. 

Conriat on the other hand can get you a better economy at a cost, and that cost is 3 extra budget (-2 for electronics investment AND -1 for the CBRA). I usually do this w/ defunding the military because you'll be net 0 budget with this extra cost ironically.

*Yugoslavia Routes:* You're always gonna go for Morna Port here, you've presumably invested in Lorren and will get high production from ATO aid 

---

**Turn 7:** 

*All Routes*: So this is up to you, either way you'll nationalize but depending on how much budget freedom/debt you want to go into, you have 3 options. Remember the more you nationalize the more ED you get:

*Nationalize 1 Company Fully:* Typically I do this if I wasn't doing the Koronti deal to *just* HOS, or to Tusk if I'm doing the dictator constitution w/o NFP support.

*Nationalize Both Companies Fully:* For this you'll obviously need to have the ACP on both companies (at the start or post-SC vote) OR SSP to arrest them both. If you use the ACP you can't arrest either of them because they'll flee.

*Nationalize 1 Majority The Other:* For gameplay reasons the fully nationalized one is typically HOS, but the benefit of this is the same ED benefit while NOT having them flee Sordland, letting you arrest both with the ACP. Only downside is this doesn't give you the ""State Control Expanded"" modifier like nationalizing both does

---

**Turn 8:**

*All Routes:* Your decrees here all depend on how deep into debt you are and if you want to end at 0 budget (to get the housing/unemployment option). If you don't care about that then you want to be below whatever debt threshold you'd be at (typically -5 if you followed the above). I recommend signing all taxes (and unless you have powerful vetos the assembly typically overrides them anyway). Always accept your relevant superpower aid, there's no downside to it. 

I typically, if you want a general idea, go for VAT (or autonomous Bergia) + FTC + Rural Schools + Centralization (via assembly). Just for general guidelines on your budget:

You can gain: +2 (net, since you're losing 1 budget later) budget from Vagsland via trade and the island deal, +2 from VAT, +3 from various taxes, +1 from healthcare benefits if you funded it, +1 from UC Aid, +1 from joining the CSP, and +1 from FTC and the ACP, and finally +1 from taxing smokes, and +1 to +4 depending on how well your economy is doing next turn

Conversely all the common money sinks here are: -1 (centralizing Bergia), -1 to -2 various decrees

*Dictator Runs:* Here you'll also pass the WRA by decree if you want to, to avoid risking it's failure or watering down, otherwise you should just wait and push it through the assembly. 

*If You Invested in Conriat*: Fund Electronics or Automotive Industry, contrary to what some on the subreddit say accepting Agricultural Aid does *not* completely overwrite this and it's still worth it assuming you've otherwise set up these synergies. 

---

**Turn 9:**

*All Routes*: *If* everything went well you should be getting +2 budget (typically), which can make the WRA you pass here net nothing. I always veto the HDB because it reduces ED.

CFA act is based on where your budget sits but just remember you can only get 3 to 5 budget from here. MRA helps Bergia and I always sign it w/ Leke, same with both taxes. CSP membership is up to you here. 

And from there you did it, congrats, you should have a full economic recover AND get Symon to call it planned. A couple of my endgame economy charts for reference (none are the highest you can go obviously but all end at 0 budget by the Symon meeting for benchmark):

*Yugoslavia Runs:* Sacrifice railroad for military funding, which I assume you will do because, well, why else would you do the Yugoslavia strategy

---

**Turn 2:**

*All Routes:* You're going to always want to do stimulus checks, PO and no ED loss are huge. For all routes you don't oppress the Bluds on, also sign the tourism act for free economy. Skipping this gets you a weaker economy but can still recover you at the end for more freedom, but business bailouts will lock you to mixed to my knowledge

---
**Turn 3:**

*All Routes:* Always do full GASOM investment for maximum profit. You have zero reason to sign the GREEN act really and it hits your economy. Also never ban both youth groups (hurts ED too much) but one or the other is fine.

When it comes to ministry funding your ED takes a hit for defunding (anything) but I typically do either all ministries funded or everything funded by the military (which I either maintain or defund). Just note that with Vagsland as an ally a mantained military can win through modernization, remove conscription, Iosef's pincer, and taking the Dome. 

*Dictatorship/Reformist/Yugoslavia:* 20% EPA is the only viable way to get planned economy at the end

*6&7 Routes:* Here you can actually go for 49% EPA, because reversing to 10% later *does* get you enough ""planned economy points"" to end with planned economy. Otherwise it won't work.

---
**Turn 4:**

*All Routes:* You're gonna always want to end at -7 or -8, depending on what word the economy is angrily yelling at you (STABLE and GROWING typically are fine at -8 at the school meeting, UNSTABLE and DANGER typically -7). 

Always do your infrastructure on time, you lose ED for delays. Also always do the research option to synergize w/ Bergia (hardest region to recover). Don't privatize education (duh). With the above in mind you can either sacrifice some things earlier OR raise taxes on small medium and large businesses for +5 budget. 

*Dictatorship/Reformist/Yugoslavia:* Invest in Lorren, both to avoid the energy crisis and for future synergies

*6&7 Routes:* Since you're at 49% you can skip Lorren investment, BUT well, you'll presumably revert back to 10% so in this *very specific* scenario you're going to want to do RI in Angland (yeah yeah shocking)

---

**Turn 5:**

*All Routes:* Always keep relaxed immigration imo, otherwise Angland will be a pain in the bum to recover. You're going to want to take the bad Agnolia deal and the negotiated down Welhen deal (you *could* do full OBT but it adds no extra economic benefit)

*Dictatorship/Reformist/6&7:* Accept UC aid, obviously. 

*Dictatorship Routes Only:* *If* you want to restrict immigration, then this route lets you relocate doctors to get you recover even with that, assuming you trade with Agnolia.

*Yugoslavia Routes:* Accept Arcasian aid, obviously

---

**Turn 6:**

*All Routes:* Keep healthcare public, always sell 2/3rds sales for maximum gain (+2 if 20%, +4 if 49%). Teach solely evolution (helps with some synergies, mandatory evolution but optional creationism might also work). Build rural schools and improve rural healthcare.

Partially related to the economy but always go with Nia's plan on 6&7 or your preferred route on other runs. If you have both USP wings on your side you can side with PFJP or NFP at the Victory Day meeting OR you can side with the NFP if you didn't because, for whatever reason, it consistently gets the assembly to centralize Bergia if you send it to them. This is mostly to save a decree slot.

*Dictatorship/Reformist/6&7:* So you have two main paths here, Sarna or Conriat Industrial Zone. 

Sarna will always be the easiest because the UC aid will get you high production with no additional investment. If your autonomous then, if the Catsland spreadsheet is right, you can skip Sarna and get green Bergia though Welhen trade, agricultural expansion, the minority rights act, and autonomy. Also CBRA isn't needed usually so you can veto. 

Conriat on the other hand can get you a better economy at a cost, and that cost is 3 extra budget (-2 for electronics investment AND -1 for the CBRA). I usually do this w/ defunding the military because you'll be net 0 budget with this extra cost ironically.

*Yugoslavia Routes:* You're always gonna go for Morna Port here, you've presumably invested in Lorren and will get high production from ATO aid 

---

**Turn 7:** 

*All Routes*: So this is up to you, either way you'll nationalize but depending on how much budget freedom/debt you want to go into, you have 3 options. Remember the more you nationalize the more ED you get:

*Nationalize 1 Company Fully:* Typically I do this if I wasn't doing the Koronti deal to *just* HOS, or to Tusk if I'm doing the dictator constitution w/o NFP support.

*Nationalize Both Companies Fully:* For this you'll obviously need to have the ACP on both companies (at the start or post-SC vote) OR SSP to arrest them both. If you use the ACP you can't arrest either of them because they'll flee.

*Nationalize 1 Majority The Other:* For gameplay reasons the fully nationalized one is typically HOS, but the benefit of this is the same ED benefit while NOT having them flee Sordland, letting you arrest both with the ACP. Only downside is this doesn't give you the ""State Control Expanded"" modifier like nationalizing both does

---

**Turn 8:**

*All Routes:* Your decrees here all depend on how deep into debt you are and if you want to end at 0 budget (to get the housing/unemployment option). If you don't care about that then you want to be below whatever debt threshold you'd be at (typically -5 if you followed the above). I recommend signing all taxes (and unless you have powerful vetos the assembly typically overrides them anyway). Always accept your relevant superpower aid, there's no downside to it. 

I typically, if you want a general idea, go for VAT (or autonomous Bergia) + FTC + Rural Schools + Centralization (via assembly). Just for general guidelines on your budget:

You can gain: +2 (net, since you're losing 1 budget later) budget from Vagsland via trade and the island deal, +2 from VAT, +3 from various taxes, +1 from healthcare benefits if you funded it, +1 from UC Aid, +1 from joining the CSP, and +1 from FTC and the ACP, and finally +1 from taxing smokes, and +1 to +4 depending on how well your economy is doing next turn

Conversely all the common money sinks here are: -1 (centralizing Bergia), -1 to -2 various decrees

*Dictator Runs:* Here you'll also pass the WRA by decree if you want to, to avoid risking it's failure or watering down, otherwise you should just wait and push it through the assembly. 

*If You Invested in Conriat*: Fund Electronics or Automotive Industry, contrary to what some on the subreddit say accepting Agricultural Aid does *not* completely overwrite this and it's still worth it assuming you've otherwise set up these synergies. 

---

**Turn 9:**

*All Routes*: *If* everything went well you should be getting +2 budget (typically), which can make the WRA you pass here net nothing. I always veto the HDB because it reduces ED.

CFA act is based on where your budget sits but just remember you can only get 3 to 5 budget from here. MRA helps Bergia and I always sign it w/ Leke, same with both taxes. CSP membership is up to you here. 

And from there you did it, congrats, you should have a full economic recover AND get Symon to call it planned. A couple of my endgame economy charts for reference (none are the highest you can go obviously but all end at 0 budget by the Symon meeting for benchmark):

This will *not* cover emergency planned eco routes because they behave very differently.

---

**The Prologue:**

*All Routes:* Economics Degree is king, because it gives you 1 ED, law is useless and you can get OMEC expulsion even if you join the CSP w/o the history degree. Also means the 1ED can bring you to the higher trade war threshold

---

**Turn 1:**

*Dictatorship/Reformist/6&7 Routes:* Always do the railroad w/ SSC, Angland is super easy to recover and railroad has better synergies

*Yugoslavia Runs:* Sacrifice railroad for military funding, which I assume you will do because, well, why else would you do the Yugoslavia strategy

**Turn 2:**

*All Routes:* You're going to always want to do stimulus checks, PO and no ED loss are huge. For all routes you don't oppress the Bluds on, also sign the tourism act for free economy. Skipping this gets you a weaker economy but can still recover you at the end for more freedom, but business bailouts will lock you to mixed to my knowledge

---
**Turn 3:**

*All Routes:* Always do full GASOM investment for maximum profit. You have zero reason to sign the GREEN act really and it hits your economy. Also never ban both youth groups (hurts ED too much) but one or the other is fine.

When it comes to ministry funding your ED takes a hit for defunding (anything) but I typically do either all ministries funded or everything funded by the military (which I either maintain or defund). Just note that with Vagsland as an ally a mantained military can win through modernization, remove conscription, Iosef's pincer, and taking the Dome.

Under President Calhoun the executive office is more powerful than ever before and America stands atop the New World.

However the glamor of being a wartime President has begun to wear off. The war has begun to slow down with the collapse of the French Government. The Red Army led by Etienne Cabet has managed to secure much of Northern France and are rapidly approaching Paris. Charles X and the remnant governments have long retreated to Nittany to be better protected by the Holy Roman Empire. The Atlantic Forces have now occupied almost all of Southern France and are supporting the Revolutionary efforts of the Reds. But back home as news from Europe slows the attention comes back to the home front.

Calhoun has become a pubic enemy of the south. His arrests of politicians associated if not having served in the Confederacy has turned politicians such as Willie P. Magnum and William H. Crawford into martyrs. The occupation of Charleston, Atlanta and Richmond over insurgent activities by the Second Sons of Liberty has led to striking animosity. A massive protest in Lexington saw a scarecrow with the likeness of the President burned. Additionally Peter Williams Jr has begun leading a 3rd way movement for the African American community as they begin to demand more from the President in terms of fighting oppression and helping out poor African communities.

Plagued by allegations of corruption, authoritarianism and manipulation of voters many Federalists begin to wonder if this controversial President is worth sticking to for 1832, fearing that his radicalism may give the Whigs an easy path to victory the Reform Federalists have put forward an alternative candidate to challenge Calhoun.

# President John Calhoun of Massachusetts

https://preview.redd.it/jm3q2hi9js3f1.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=be016fbc64a58eb8d2a50790ed7e7433ed22eeff

It comes as no surprise that the incumbent President would seek re-election. He has done little to keep it a secret he intends to seek a full 3 terms which has not been done since the first President. Calhoun has had an inporessively efficient Presidency as he continues to secure his plan of sidelining congress and allowing the President to enact what he believes is necessary to protect the nation. Calhoun and his allies have consistently pressed the issue that America is under threat internally and abroad, first from the French, then the traitorous southerners, now his targets begin moving towards the flurry of European immigrants fleeing the reactionary powers of Europe.

America has far too long been a nation of chaos but Calhoun offers a path he calls “peace by force.” With the beginning of the Second French Revolution the Atlanticist Victory in the war is all but achieved, however America is treated almost as a pariah state by its European counter-parts. Even Spain, under newly elected President Juan Mendizabal would disengage largely with the United States as it began looking to Britain for security in the face of a more unified central and Eastern Europe. Louisiana is currently going through its own radical reshaping under President John Burr and his cabal of left winged political outcasts. Now with the knowledge that Britain is attempting to supply and strengthen Louisiana and Mexico? It is clear America is on her own and the world is out to get her. The only way to protect America is by centralising power, expanding the influence of the national bank, and building a large army and navy to fully contend with Britain.

However the incumbent is not going entirely unchallenged. Americans have began to sour on the President, particularly in regards to him targeting seemingly innocent people such as Senator Willie Magnum and many of the European settlers who fled the revolutionary wars. Not only that but the national economy is on the verge of breaking down. Due to the war and tariff policies inflation has begun to skyrocket while the national economy takes a down turn. The ranks of the poor grow and the national debt rise every day. Calhoun swears he has control of the situation and promises the end of the war will fix the situation.

There are few Federalists in government with the expeirence of Senator Rush. He served in a long of excellent leaders to fill the ever crucial role of Secretary of State, holding the office during the John Jay Administration. During his time he aided the aging President in navigating the complexities of the 1820s and was crucial in the drafting and singing of the Treaty of Alliance with Spain. After not being retained by President Harrison after his election Rush returned to Pennsylvania. He would launch a political comeback by defeating Whig Senator Walter Lowrie in the 1830 midterm elections and has since been a critical voice of compromise between Calhoun and Sergeant.

Rush is supportive of the Federalist agenda but is known much more for his pragmatism and moderate views. He, unlike many of his predecessors, supports popular democracy and believes in the enfranchisement of voters. He favors efforts to expand public education and civic development. He fears Calhouns rapid expansion of power and, while a centralist himself, he believes Calhoun has offset the balance of power to a dangerous level by elevating the Presidency over congress and the judiciary. Not only that but he is a vocal critic of the sedition act of 1831. As for the national bank he believes the institution is out of control and needs to be reigned back in, as such he is partial to bank reform and has shown willingness to work with Whigs on the matter should he succeed.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1kvj6ez/new_ideology_sugar_daddysm_the_next_step_on/,Easy immigration helps the economy,"New Ideology: Sugar Daddysm, the Next Step on Capitalism and Why it's Important","I think I will create a new ideology.

Sugar Daddysm.

It's basically capitalism with emphasis on reproductive rights for rich men and women that choose to share them or get paid by them.

Like, what's the point of being smart if you're not rich. What's the point of being richer if you are not happy?

Well, it turns out that happiness is induced by dopamine and serotonin. In most vertebrate organism, those happened when your centralized neuron system recognize that you have achieved or in the process of achieving reproductive success.

In short, in humans, at least, what's the point of being rich if you don't have more children and pass on your wealth to help your own children got rich?

Will this improve economy? Sure. Rich kids are richer. So a good way to evolve the economy and eliminate poverty is for rich people to have more children and poor people to have fewer.

Like in Capitalism, we need freedom for smarter superior people to simply make way more money productively like Elon.

Also through capitalism, people that are economically productive like Elon should also have the right or be allowed to have many smart beautiful children.

Here, many means as many as he can afford. Obviously Elon would spend more per child than the poor and middle class spend per child, but it's up to Elon and the mom, and not up to government regulation.

If Elon wants to have 100k children and spend the median child support of $500 a month, it's up to Elon and the mom. It's already more than Median.

Here allowed means without legal complexity. For example, Elon did it in Texas, the only state in US with maximum child support amount. Then he did it via surrogate.

Bigotry against sugar daddies and those associated with them are often justified by blood libels.

For example, coercive acts like husbands preventing their wives from divorcing is seen positively as acts of love. Before no fault divorce and in many countries without clear no fault divorce laws, women often have a hard time divorcing their husband even though she can get richer sugar daddies.

Many conservatives think that monogamy is best for children. But those often are justified with unclear measure. For example, they would argue that children from a 2 parents family have optimum psychological growth or best for the children's well being. But what counts as optimum psychological growth is unclear.

Why not use clearly more measurable data like children's expected IQ or future income or wealth?

Marriage is obviously bad because government is such a bad pimp it shouldn't have been in marriage business in the first place. However, government prohibits more straightforward transactional sex or even better pimps.

Sugar Daddysm.

It's basically capitalism with emphasis on reproductive rights for rich men and women that choose to share them or get paid by them.

Like, what's the point of being smart if you're not rich. What's the point of being richer if you are not happy?

Well, it turns out that happiness is induced by dopamine and serotonin. In most vertebrate organism, those happened when your centralized neuron system recognize that you have achieved or in the process of achieving reproductive success.

In short, in humans, at least, what's the point of being rich if you don't have more children and pass on your wealth to help your own children got rich?

Will this improve economy? Sure. Rich kids are richer. So a good way to evolve the economy and eliminate poverty is for rich people to have more children and poor people to have fewer.

Like in Capitalism, we need freedom for smarter superior people to simply make way more money productively like Elon.

Also through capitalism, people that are economically productive like Elon should also have the right or be allowed to have many smart beautiful children.

Here, many means as many as he can afford. Obviously Elon would spend more per child than the poor and middle class spend per child, but it's up to Elon and the mom, and not up to government regulation.

If Elon wants to have 100k children and spend the median child support of $500 a month, it's up to Elon and the mom. It's already more than Median.

Here allowed means without legal complexity. For example, Elon did it in Texas, the only state in US with maximum child support amount. Then he did it via surrogate.

If instead Elon wants a harem and do this the natural way, it's up to him and the moms.

https://www.reddit.com/r/I_DONT_LIKE/comments/1kzi6bx/i_dont_like_the_entire_boomer_generations_lack_of/,Easy immigration helps the economy,I don't like the entire Boomer generations lack of spine,"Let me clarify, this is n't going to be a 100% everybody born at that time is going to fit into this category kind of thing. It's just something I've noticed more and more that only seems to really happen with people who are alive in the late '50s - 90s but nothing really beyond that. The problem has a simple explanation and I'll get into that before I actually address the problem at hand. 

Before the invention of the internet, most people didn't have the luxury of encyclopedias in their home, and the people who did have encyclopedias learned the unfortunate facts of Life, which are, encyclopedias are supposed to cover so many different subjects and it's impossible to do that without creating an entire library area of books without essentially paraphrasing or minimizing the amount of information available. 

When somebody told you something you typically believed it was true in that time, because you had nothing else really to go on other than other people's word and maybe if you had time to do the research you could, but most people didn't. 

Now we got the problem that I have you reading this to learn about which is, people not fact-checking information or not capable of fact checking The information due to a lack of understanding when it comes to search engines and or using computers/ the internet effectively. 

Don't get me wrong, it's got to be hard when technology comes out of nowhere and basically replaces everything you knew before, but that's not an acceptable excuse to stay ignorant or stupid in the face of all the information you could ever want available at your fingertips at any given time. 

Look, I'm not in any way shape or form political and I hope this doesn't end up turning into some kind of political argument because, I could give a shit, Republican, Democrat, they're both only concerned with the people who are like themselves, or people who can help advance their career beyond presidency or whatever because that's how you get to that point. To begin with, you have to literally use people to advance yourself to the point of being able to run president, which is very manipulative, very underhanded, and oftentimes involves some shady shit either being known or participated in. 

The current administration has told more bold-faced lies to the American people than anybody else in history including televangelists and them assholes that started pyramid schemes/ sell timeshares. The worst part is, all of the information is easily refuted if you know how to Google anything other than something that'll prove you right about whatever it is you're wanting to look up. If I look up, how is Trump going to save America? I'm sure I'm going to get a whole lot of propaganda and misinformation, if I look up. What is Trump's tariff policy doing to the economy, I'll get an entirely different perspective, and if I make sure to not select something written by Democrats, I might even get the truth. 

I think the biggest issue I'm facing right now is people are so afraid to acknowledge their darker nature and allow it to flow over into their everyday life because they're not feeding it and so it's having to come out and eat on its own. If That makes any sense. 🤔

What I'm trying to say is: each and every one of us has both love and fear inside of us at all times. Love is the most powerful force in the universe and actually according to the Bible, the source of our creation as well. However, I do believe the fall of Man was physicality and with physicality came fear. Being in a mortal shell is a unique experience because, despite our own Divinity, we now fear death, mostly out of lack of understanding. So, fear is the negative emotion that drives all other negative emotions to come into play. If you think about it, if you're afraid of something long enough, you start feeling silly for being afraid and get angry instead. Anger is a gift. Anger is also easily polarized because it's not able to come out unless you're dealing with the fight or flight part of your brain aka the amygdala or reptile brain. Fight or flight kicks in and it hijacks the rest of your brain in the sense that it keeps the emotional side from talking to The logical side and tells you to act immediately on whatever emotion you're feeling which is typically in fear. So now that you're acting without any kind of logic, it's real easy to be manipulated with NLP or dark psychology as they like to call it in certain texts. Dark psychology is used almost constantly and you wouldn't even be aware of it because, you weren't interested in learning about it either because you thought The only reason to know it would be to use it against people, or you didn't think that it could possibly be something you would need to defend yourself from. Advertisers. Use it, politicians. Use the fuck out of it, corporations use it. Banks use it, hell, a lot of people have spouses that use it against them all the time and they would have no idea because, it's not common knowledge. So now that we've covered that area of things, I want to point out that because of this ability that the current administration has to use people 's negative emotions as a catalyst pushing their agenda forward. We now have a whole group of individuals who are all kinds of angry at trans people, immigrants, Democrats, and whoever else they can point the finger at and be angry with despite the fact that trans people only make up about 0.1% of the population, immigrants built this nation, Democrats aren't any different than Republicans and they both do the same shit, and anybody else is typically just people who disagree with their propaganda machine. And it's absurd how easy it is to get these people to literally become a propaganda machine and just spew all the nonsense back out into society that they've been getting fed all day on Fox News or YouTube or  truth (🤣🤣🤣🤣)  social

The same  people who taught me to not only question what was being told to me as a child, but even explain that just because somebody is supposed to look out for you and supposed to be telling you the truth doesn't mean they will and that I shouldn't even trust people who are in charge just based on the fact they were in charge. I should always think about what they were asking me to do, they now Believe at any and everything they hear coming out of Trump's mouth or any one of his little cronies and won't look at any kind of facts even if there's multiple sources. They will say it's all fake because that's what they've been told and that's what they believe. They're literally part of a cult I guess, because they all think they're making America great by sabotaging the shit out of it. It and don't even realize that once they're done running off all the immigrants and demonizing the lgbtq community again, the only people left to weed out are going to be senior citizens living on disability or social security....  Even musk said it seems to be a bunch of bullshit and was furious when he found out that the ""Big beautiful Bill"" was going to raise the debt ceiling by an insane amount of money while only promising to get that exact same amount of money back over 10 years which is a funny way of saying we're borrowing this money for whatever we need to use it for, get it back to you if we can.

I have seen so many things that dispute every bit of what Trump claims he's fighting for. I've seen documents that came out before he even ran for office this election that basically proved it wasn't Trump that was doing a lot of the things he's taking credit for. It was Biden, ironically, he's taking credit for doing things that Biden did while also slandering the shit out of his name, despite the fact that he has no evidence to back any of it up, and if he was a criminal like Trump said, he would be in prison, obviously. 

In the corruption.... 


So, to recap, what I really don't like, is people who think they know shit and refuse to acknowledge that they might be wrong. Be wrong. People who could see things going on that aren't okay and do nothing about them. People who would rather sit in silence than speak their mind when things are going. Bad. People who are too afraid to be their authentic self in the face of any kind of pushback people who allow marginalized groups of individuals to continue to be oppressed and hurt with the only justification being, well, at least white folks will make it right? 

I think the most upsetting part of all this is, there's universal laws, you can't do shitty things and think everything's going to be okay. Okay. If you're not going to pay directly for the sins you've committed during your lifetime, please believe the kids will. And they already are, but, you're telling yourself that's okay, right? Right? At least we'll have enough to pay the bills, right? You keep forgetting. We're not even focusing on the problem. Corporations are the problem. The wealth class imbalance is a problem. Insane amounts of debt being racked up by our government while we can't even afford to live. Other than check to check is a fucking major problem. Anybody who says they have solutions for those Problems is definitely lying because these are things that happened over the course of hundreds of years and will take probably just as long to figure out the most mutually beneficial way to correct them.

Or communism/ socialism is also an option, but, the government has demonized those two things so much over the years that people don't even know what the actual definition of either one of them is., you're thinking that communism and socialism is the worst possible scenario. If done right, communism is exactly what would work, but it's never been done right before and it probably never will for the same reason. We're not a democracy. We're a Republic and the Republic is corrupt to the point of being a pseudo totalitarian regime

I should always think about what they were asking me to do, they now Believe at any and everything they hear coming out of Trump's mouth or any one of his little cronies and won't look at any kind of facts even if there's multiple sources. They will say it's all fake because that's what they've been told and that's what they believe. They're literally part of a cult I guess, because they all think they're making America great by sabotaging the shit out of it. It and don't even realize that once they're done running off all the immigrants and demonizing the lgbtq community again, the only people left to weed out are going to be senior citizens living on disability or social security....  Even musk said it seems to be a bunch of bullshit and was furious when he found out that the ""Big beautiful Bill"" was going to raise the debt ceiling by an insane amount of money while only promising to get that exact same amount of money back over 10 years which is a funny way of saying we're borrowing this money for whatever we need to use it for, get it back to you if we can.

I have seen so many things that dispute every bit of what Trump claims he's fighting for. I've seen documents that came out before he even ran for office this election that basically proved it wasn't Trump that was doing a lot of the things he's taking credit for. It was Biden, ironically, he's taking credit for doing things that Biden did while also slandering the shit out of his name, despite the fact that he has no evidence to back any of it up, and if he was a criminal like Trump said, he would be in prison, obviously. 

In the corruption.... 


So, to recap, what I really don't like, is people who think they know shit and refuse to acknowledge that they might be wrong. Be wrong. People who could see things going on that aren't okay and do nothing about them. People who would rather sit in silence than speak their mind when things are going. Bad. People who are too afraid to be their authentic self in the face of any kind of pushback people who allow marginalized groups of individuals to continue to be oppressed and hurt with the only justification being, well, at least white folks will make it right? 

I think the most upsetting part of all this is, there's universal laws, you can't do shitty things and think everything's going to be okay. Okay. If you're not going to pay directly for the sins you've committed during your lifetime, please believe the kids will. And they already are, but, you're telling yourself that's okay, right? Right? At least we'll have enough to pay the bills, right? You keep forgetting. We're not even focusing on the problem. Corporations are the problem. The wealth class imbalance is a problem. Insane amounts of debt being racked up by our government while we can't even afford to live. Other than check to check is a fucking major problem. Anybody who says they have solutions for those Problems is definitely lying because these are things that happened over the course of hundreds of years and will take probably just as long to figure out the most mutually beneficial way to correct them.

Or communism/ socialism is also an option, but, the government has demonized those two things so much over the years that people don't even know what the actual definition of either one of them is., you're thinking that communism and socialism is the worst possible scenario. If done right, communism is exactly what would work, but it's never been done right before and it probably never will for the same reason. We're not a democracy. We're a Republic and the Republic is corrupt to the point of being a pseudo totalitarian regime

100% everybody  at that time is going to fit into this category kind of thing. It's just something I've noticed more and more that only seems to really happen with people who are alive in the late '50s - 90s but nothing really beyond that. The problem has a simple explanation and I'll get into that before I actually address the problem at hand. 

Before the invention of the internet, most people didn't have the luxury of encyclopedias in their home, and the people who did have encyclopedias learned the unfortunate facts of Life, which are, encyclopedias are supposed to cover so many different subjects and it's impossible to do that without creating an entire library area of books without essentially paraphrasing or minimizing the amount of information available. 

When somebody told you something you typically believed it was true in that time, because you had nothing else really to go on other than other people's word and maybe if you had time to do the research you could, but most people didn't. 

Now we got the problem that I have you reading this to learn about which is, people not fact-checking information or not capable of fact checking The information due to a lack of understanding when it comes to search engines and or using computers/ the internet effectively. 

Don't get me wrong, it's got to be hard when technology comes out of nowhere and basically replaces everything you knew before, but that's not an acceptable excuse to stay ignorant or stupid in the face of all the information you could ever want available at your fingertips at any given time. 

Look, I'm not in any way shape or form political and I hope this doesn't end up turning into some kind of political argument because, I could give a shit, Republican, Democrat, they're both only concerned with the people who are like themselves, or people who can help advance their career beyond presidency or whatever because that's how you get to that point. To begin with, you have to literally use people to advance yourself to the point of being able to run , which is very manipulative, very underhanded, and oftentimes involves some shady shit either being known or participated in. 

The current administration has told more bold-faced lies to the American people than anybody else in history including televangelists and them assholes that started pyramid schemes/ sell timeshares. The worst part is, all of the information is easily refuted if you know how to Google anything other than something that'll prove you  about whatever it is you're wanting to look up. If I look up, how is Trump going to save America? I'm sure I'm going to get a whole lot of propaganda and misinformation, if I look up. What is Trump's tariff policy doing to the economy, I'll get an entirely different perspective, and if I make sure to not select something written by Democrats, I might even get the truth. 

I think the biggest issue I'm facing  now is people are so afraid to acknowledge their darker nature and allow it to flow over into their everyday life because they're not feeding it and so it's having to come out and eat on its own. If That makes any sense. 🤔

What I'm trying to say is: each and every one of us has both love and fear inside of us at all times. Love is the most powerful force in the universe and actually according to the Bible, the source of our creation as well. However, I do believe the fall of Man was physicality and with physicality came fear. Being in a mortal shell is a unique experience because, despite our own Divinity, we now fear death, mostly out of lack of understanding. So, fear is the negative emotion that drives all other negative emotions to come into play. If you think about it, if you're afraid of something long enough, you start feeling silly for being afraid and get angry instead. Anger is a gift. Anger is also easily polarized because it's not able to come out unless you're dealing with the fight or flight part of your brain aka the amygdala or reptile brain. Fight or flight kicks in and it hijacks the rest of your brain in the sense that it keeps the emotional side from talking to The logical side and tells you to act immediately on whatever emotion you're feeling which is typically in fear. So now that you're acting without any kind of logic, it's real easy to be manipulated with NLP or dark psychology as they like to call it in certain texts. Dark psychology is used almost constantly and you wouldn't even be aware of it because, you weren't interested in learning about it either because you thought The only reason to know it would be to use it against people, or you didn't think that it could possibly be something you would need to defend yourself from. Advertisers. Use it, politicians. Use the fuck out of it, corporations use it. Banks use it, hell, a lot of people have spouses that use it against them all the time and they would have no idea because, it's not common knowledge. So now that we've covered that area of things, I want to point out that because of this ability that the current administration has to use people 's negative emotions as a catalyst pushing their agenda forward. We now have a whole group of individuals who are all kinds of angry at trans people, , Democrats, and whoever else they can point the finger at and be angry with despite the fact that trans people only make up about 0.1% of the population,  built this nation, Democrats aren't any different than Republicans and they both do the same shit, and anybody else is typically just people who disagree with their propaganda machine.

https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityNetwork/comments/1kxhavt/effect_of_immigration_on_american_economy_essay/,Easy immigration helps the economy,Effect of Immigration on American Economy Essay,"## Introduction

The United States became a superpower in the early 20th century through the hard work of two major components of American society, the native inhabitants and immigrants. But as one looks even further the United States became a nation through the combined efforts of people that originated from other continents.

The majority of were whites and they can trace their ancestry to Europe. African Americans on the other hand can trace their ancestry to Africa and the Caribbean Islands. In the past there was no problem with regards to mass movement of people into the US but in recent decades this nation saw an influx of immigrants from Asia, Puerto Rico and Mexico and the issue of immigration began to take shape. It is important to tackle this issue because immigration is both a positive and negative force when it comes to the US economy.

The issue when it comes to immigration is based on an economic principle that resources are not infinite. This statement can be expanded to mean that resources are fixed like a family of five sharing a loaf of bread. In an ideal scenario there is enough food for everyone but if this family grows in size not everyone will get enough nourishment.

The same thing can be said with the increasing number of non-native born workers coming into the United States and competing with native-born Americans for limited number of jobs. The competition between the two groups is intensified by the fact that immigrant works are willing to work for lower pay.

## The US Economy

There are many who are saying that immigration is always a bad thing for America. The reason for saying so is embedded in this statement: “a surge of low-skilled immigrants should increase the supply of such workers, driving down wages at the expense of working-class Americans” (Henderson 1).

It does not require a genius to understand the forces of competition at work. Consider for instance a city’s construction industry. There are only a finite number of houses and buildings that can be built in a given time. Therefore, there are a fixed number of workers that are needed by construction companies. Imagine the sudden increase of immigrant workers into that particular city and in an instant native-born works are out of work. They are suddenly unemployed because they cannot compete with low wages.

The concern raised by many Americans is based on alarming numbers. According to the U.S. Census Bureaus’ March 2005 survey it was estimated that the United States is home to “11.5 to 12 million illegal immigrants and of that number 6.2 million come Mexico and about 2.5 million come from the rest of Latin America” (Forbes 1).

A few million spread all over the United States should not pose a threat to the job security of US citizens. But 12 million workers ready to accept low-pay can significantly alter the job market. In a weak economy the call to reduce the number of immigrant workers can be deafening.

The indirect impact of immigration to the economy is seen in the significant use of resources to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country as well as the high cost of litigation to deport them. According to one report “Immigration courts are so jammed it can often take more than a year for a judge to rule on a deportation case” (Jordan 1).

If one factors in crime statistics one can also highlight another economic impact of immigration especially when it comes to undocumented aliens. However, from a macroeconomic point of view it is best to limit the discussion to the labor market.

The illustration provided earlier helps clarify the reason why many Americans are worried about the negative economic impact of immigrant workers. But there are those who are saying that a macroeconomic perspective of the issue can yield different results. On the other side of the fence there business leaders and economists who asserted that immigrant workers can be a boon to the US economy.

They supported their assertion with research findings that the impact of immigration “are difficult to disentangle from other factors that have dampened wage growth for most workers in recent decades, including new technologies, the decline in manufacturing jobs, the drop in unionization, globalization and recessions” (Henderson 1). In other words it is easy to blame immigrant workers because they are highly visible but if one uses a more scientific approach to the issue the results are surprising.

## The Importance of Immigrant Workers

Economists and business leaders are saying that immigrant workers are important contributors to the US economy. They are valuable in terms of answering the employment call for menial jobs. According to one commentary, “They do jobs most Americans wouldn’t take, for wages they wouldn’t want” (Quintanilla 1).

For example, a restaurant must be well-managed and must offer sumptuous meals but if there are no dishwashers it is impossible to offer high-quality service. But there are only a few native-born Americans who are willing to work as dishwashers.

It is important to look at the big picture and at the same time determine the direct effect of allowing immigrant workers to live and work in this country.

A Harvard University study in 2004 discovered that “immigration – both legal and illegal – reduced annual earnings for American-born men by 3.7 percent, or nearly $1,700 … for those without a high school degree, the effect was double that, with wages down 7.4 percent” (Quintanilla 1). This study is undeniable proof that there are American citizens that are at a disadvantage when it comes to immigrant workers.

Aside from those who do not have high school diplomas, the segment of the population that are severely affected by illegal immigration are “blacks and native-born Hispanics, according to George Borjas, a Harvard University economist who has studied immigration for years” (Henderson 1). Although these research findings strengthened the argument of those who opposed the influx of immigrant workers, the research data also clarified the fact that not all Americans are negatively affected by this trend.

In addition many economists are saying that US consumers benefit from lower prices because of the low wages paid to immigrants but also from the fact that “lower-wage labor helps create more work for higher-skilled, higher-paid workers who are generally native born” (Isidore 1).

Consider for instance the following report from the U.S. Department of Labor: “at least half of the nearly 2 million crop workers in the United States are illegal aliens … the cheap labor they provide is crucial to the $30 billion U.S. farm industry” (Parker 1). Imagine a US labor market without immigrant workers and it is easy to see how devastating it would be if migrant workers are no longer allowed to enter the United States.

The Hispanics alone represent 25% of workers in the meat and poultry industry; 24% of workers in the drywall and ceiling tile installation industry; and 24% of dishwashers in US restaurants (Grow 1). These figures explain why “some US industries have become so dependent on illegal labor that a wholesale expulsion would be crippling” (Grow 1).

Another positive impact of immigration is that it can be used to deter relocation of businesses abroad. According to economists “the easier it is to find cheap immigrant labor at home, the less likely that production will relocate offshore” (Cowen 1). It would be a tremendous boost to the American economy if US-based companies no longer relocate their operations in China or India.

The fear that immigrant workers will steal available jobs away from Americans must be clarified even further. According to economists, the decade between 1960 and 2000, was the time period when “working-age native born U.S. residents without a high school degree fell to 12% from 50% of the population” (The Wall Street Journal 1).

The implication is that Americans must be thankful for the high number of immigrants because otherwise an overqualified native-born American will have to fill in a low-paying job (The Wall Street Journal 1). But more than that, it highlighted the fact that there is a specific segment of the population that are significantly affected by immigrant workers while the rest of the United States benefited extremely well because of their presence.

It cannot be denied that there are segments of the population that will be severely affected by the influx of immigrant workers in this country. Poorly educated Americans competing with low-paying jobs will be negatively affected. Native-born Americans without a high school diploma will also find it difficult to find work in farms, factories, and construction sites. However, the number of native-born Americans that have no high school diplomas are decreasing based on one research finding cited earlier.

From a macroeconomic standpoint however, the US economy is made more cost-efficient by the presence of migrant workers. Business owners are happy with the ability to hire manual laborers and low-pay workers for job that does not require specialized skills. It is a boon to their business because they can reduce the cost of production.

Thus, the goods and services can be priced competitively. If US companies can tap immigrant workers in order to create a cost-efficient operation then there is no need to move their business abroad. But analysis made at the macroeconomic level is rarely appreciated by the average American who continually expresses concern regarding the impact of immigration to this country.

A surprising development was reported by the New York Times that Mexican migration has “sputtered to a trickle due to various factors such as improving economic conditions in Mexico, border crime and economic slowdowns, and immigrant crackdowns” (Cave 1). If this trend continues then one can clearly see what will happen to the US economy if migrant workers are no longer interested to live and work in this country.

## Conclusion

Immigrant workers are only a threat to a specific segment of the US population. This group is comprised of native-born Americans without a high school diploma and do not have the necessary resources to create their own business.

But overall immigrant workers are a boon to the American economy because they are willing to work for a job that many native-born Americans feel are below their standards. No one is excited to work as a dishwasher or a farm help but without farm workers and dishwashers the United States economy cannot expand and business leaders will never be able to provide low-priced but quality products and services.

The United States became a superpower in the early 20th century through the hard work of two major components of American society, the native inhabitants and immigrants. But as one looks even further the United States became a nation through the combined efforts of people that originated from other continents.

The majority of were whites and they can trace their ancestry to Europe. African Americans on the other hand can trace their ancestry to Africa and the Caribbean Islands. In the past there was no problem with regards to mass movement of people into the US but in recent decades this nation saw an influx of immigrants from Asia, Puerto Rico and Mexico and the issue of immigration began to take shape. It is important to tackle this issue because immigration is both a positive and negative force when it comes to the US economy.

The issue when it comes to immigration is based on an economic principle that resources are not infinite. This statement can be expanded to mean that resources are fixed like a family of five sharing a loaf of bread. In an ideal scenario there is enough food for everyone but if this family grows in size not everyone will get enough nourishment.

The same thing can be said with the increasing number of non-native born workers coming into the United States and competing with native-born Americans for limited number of jobs. The competition between the two groups is intensified by the fact that immigrant works are willing to work for lower pay.

## The US Economy

There are many who are saying that immigration is always a bad thing for America. The reason for saying so is embedded in this statement: “a surge of low-skilled immigrants should increase the supply of such workers, driving down wages at the expense of working-class Americans” (Henderson 1).

It does not require a genius to understand the forces of competition at work. Consider for instance a city’s construction industry. There are only a finite number of houses and buildings that can be built in a given time. Therefore, there are a fixed number of workers that are needed by construction companies. Imagine the sudden increase of immigrant workers into that particular city and in an instant native-born works are out of work. They are suddenly unemployed because they cannot compete with low wages.

The concern raised by many Americans is based on alarming numbers. According to the U.S. Census Bureaus’ March 2005 survey it was estimated that the United States is home to “11.5 to 12 million illegal immigrants and of that number 6.2 million come Mexico and about 2.5 million come from the rest of Latin America” (Forbes 1).

The United States became a superpower in the early 20th century through the hard work of two major components of American society, the native inhabitants and . But as one looks even further the United States became a nation through the combined efforts of people that originated from other continents.

The majority of were whites and they can trace their ancestry to Europe. African Americans on the other hand can trace their ancestry to Africa and the Caribbean Islands. In the past there was no problem with regards to mass movement of people into the US but in recent decades this nation saw an influx of  from Asia, Puerto Rico and Mexico and the issue of immigration began to take shape. It is important to tackle this issue because immigration is both a positive and negative force when it comes to the US economy.

The issue when it comes to immigration is based on an  principle that resources are not infinite. This statement can be expanded to mean that resources are fixed like a family of five sharing a loaf of bread. In an ideal scenario there is enough food for everyone but if this family grows in size not everyone will get enough nourishment.

The same thing can be said with the increasing number of non-native  workers coming into the United States and competing with native- Americans for limited number of jobs. The competition between the two groups is intensified by the fact that immigrant works are willing to work for lower pay.

## The US Economy

There are many who are saying that immigration is always a bad thing for America. The reason for saying so is embedded in this statement: “a surge of low-skilled  should increase the supply of such workers, driving down wages at the expense of working-class Americans” (Henderson 1).

It does not require a genius to understand the forces of competition at work. Consider for instance a city’s construction industry. There are only a finite number of houses and buildings that can be built in a given time. Therefore, there are a fixed number of workers that are needed by construction companies. Imagine the sudden increase of immigrant workers into that particular city and in an instant native- works are out of work. They are suddenly unemployed because they cannot compete with low wages.

The concern raised by many Americans is based on alarming numbers. According to the U.S. Census Bureaus’ March 2005 survey it was estimated that the United States is home to “11.5 to 12 million   and of that number 6.2 million come Mexico and about 2.5 million come from the rest of Latin America” (Forbes 1).

A few million spread all over the United States should not pose a threat to the job security of US citizens. But 12 million workers ready to accept low-pay can significantly alter the job market. In a weak economy the call to reduce the number of immigrant workers can be deafening.

The indirect impact of immigration to the economy is seen in the significant use of resources to prevent   from entering the country as well as the high cost of litigation to deport them. According to one report “Immigration courts are so jammed it can often take more than a year for a judge to rule on a deportation case” (Jordan 1).

If one factors in crime statistics one can also highlight another  impact of immigration especially when it comes to undocumented aliens. However, from a macroeconomic point of view it is best to limit the discussion to the labor market.

The illustration provided earlier helps clarify the reason why many Americans are worried about the negative  impact of immigrant workers. But there are those who are saying that a macroeconomic perspective of the issue can yield different results. On the other side of the fence there business leaders and economists who asserted that immigrant workers can be a boon to the US economy.

They supported their assertion with research findings that the impact of immigration “are difficult to disentangle from other factors that have dampened wage growth for most workers in recent decades, including new technologies, the decline in manufacturing jobs, the drop in unionization, globalization and recessions” (Henderson 1). In other words it is easy to blame immigrant workers because they are highly visible but if one uses a more scientific approach to the issue the results are surprising.

## The Importance of Immigrant Workers

Economists and business leaders are saying that immigrant workers are important contributors to the US economy. They are valuable in terms of answering the employment call for menial jobs. According to one commentary, “They do jobs most Americans wouldn’t take, for wages they wouldn’t want” (Quintanilla 1).

For example, a restaurant must be well-managed and must offer sumptuous meals but if there are no dishwashers it is impossible to offer high-quality service. But there are only a few native- Americans who are willing to work as dishwashers.

It is important to look at the big picture and at the same time determine the direct effect of allowing immigrant workers to live and work in this country.

A Harvard University study in 2004 discovered that “immigration – both legal and  – reduced annual earnings for American- men by 3.7 percent, or nearly $1,700 … for those without a high school degree, the effect was double that, with wages down 7.4 percent” (Quintanilla 1). This study is undeniable proof that there are American citizens that are at a disadvantage when it comes to immigrant workers.

Aside from those who do not have high school diplomas, the segment of the population that are severely affected by  immigration are “blacks and native- Hispanics, according to George Borjas, a Harvard University economist who has studied immigration for years” (Henderson 1). Although these research findings strengthened the argument of those who opposed the influx of immigrant workers, the research data also clarified the fact that not all Americans are negatively affected by this trend.

In addition many economists are saying that US consumers benefit from lower prices because of the low wages paid to  but also from the fact that “lower-wage labor helps create more work for higher-skilled, higher-paid workers who are generally native ” (Isidore 1).

Consider for instance the following report from the U.S. Department of Labor: “at least half of the nearly 2 million crop workers in the United States are  aliens … the cheap labor they provide is crucial to the $30 billion U.S. farm industry” (Parker 1). Imagine a US labor market without immigrant workers and it is easy to see how devastating it would be if migrant workers are no longer allowed to enter the United States.

The Hispanics alone represent 25% of workers in the meat and poultry industry; 24% of workers in the drywall and ceiling tile installation industry; and 24% of dishwashers in US restaurants (Grow 1). These figures explain why “some US industries have become so dependent on  labor that a wholesale expulsion would be crippling” (Grow 1).

Another positive impact of immigration is that it can be used to deter relocation of businesses abroad. According to economists “the easier it is to find cheap immigrant labor at home, the less likely that production will relocate offshore” (Cowen 1). It would be a tremendous boost to the American economy if US-based companies no longer relocate their operations in  or India.

The fear that immigrant workers will steal available jobs away from Americans must be clarified even further. According to economists, the decade between 1960 and 2000, was the time period when “working-age native  U.S. residents without a high school degree fell to 12% from 50% of the population” (The Wall Street Journal 1).

The implication is that Americans must be thankful for the high number of  because otherwise an overqualified native- American will have to fill in a low-paying job (The Wall Street Journal 1). But more than that, it highlighted the fact that there is a specific segment of the population that are significantly affected by immigrant workers while the rest of the United States benefited extremely well because of their presence.

It cannot be denied that there are segments of the population that will be severely affected by the influx of immigrant workers in this country. Poorly educated Americans competing with low-paying jobs will be negatively affected. Native- Americans without a high school diploma will also find it difficult to find work in farms, factories, and construction sites. However, the number of native- Americans that have no high school diplomas are decreasing based on one research finding cited earlier.

From a macroeconomic standpoint however, the US economy is made more cost-efficient by the presence of migrant workers. Business owners are happy with the ability to hire manual laborers and low-pay workers for job that does not require specialized skills. It is a boon to their business because they can reduce the cost of production.

Thus, the goods and services can be priced competitively. If US companies can tap immigrant workers in order to create a cost-efficient operation then there is no need to move their business abroad. But analysis made at the macroeconomic level is rarely appreciated by the average American who continually expresses concern regarding the impact of immigration to this country.

A surprising development was reported by the New York Times that Mexican migration has “sputtered to a trickle due to various factors such as improving  conditions in Mexico, border crime and  slowdowns, and immigrant crackdowns” (Cave 1). If this trend continues then one can clearly see what will happen to the US economy if migrant workers are no longer interested to live and work in this country.

## Conclusion

Immigrant workers are only a threat to a specific segment of the US population. This group is comprised of native- Americans without a high school diploma and do not have the necessary resources to create their own business.

But overall immigrant workers are a boon to the American economy because they are willing to work for a job that many native- Americans feel are below their standards. No one is excited to work as a dishwasher or a farm help but without farm workers and dishwashers the United States economy cannot expand and business leaders will never be able to provide low-priced but quality products and services.

# the us economy there are many who are saying that immigration is always a thing for america . the reason for saying so is embedded in this statement : “ a surge of low-skilled  should increase the supply of such workers , driving down wages at the expense of working-class americans ” ( henderson 1 ) . it does not require a to understand the forces of competition at . consider for instance a city ’ s construction industry . there are only a finite number of houses and buildings that can be built in a given time . therefore , there are a fixed number of workers that are needed by construction companies . imagine the sudden increase of immigrant workers into that particular city and in an instant native- are out of . they are suddenly because they can not compete with low wages . the raised by many americans is based on numbers . according to the u.s. census bureaus ’ march 2005 survey it was estimated that the united states is home to “ 11.5 to 12 million  and of that number 6.2 million come mexico and about 2.5 million come from the rest of latin america ” ( forbes 1 ) . a few million spread all over the united states should not pose a to the job security of us citizens . but 12 million workers to accept low-pay can significantly alter the job market . in a economy the call to reduce the number of immigrant workers can be deafening . the indirect impact of immigration to the economy is seen in the use of resources to prevent  from entering the country as as the high cost of litigation to deport them . according to one report “ immigration courts are so jammed it can often take more than a year for a judge to rule on a deportation case ” ( jordan 1 ) . if one factors in statistics one can also highlight another  impact of immigration especially when it comes to aliens . however , from a macroeconomic point of view it is to the discussion to the labor market . the illustration provided earlier helps clarify the reason why many americans are about the  impact of immigrant workers . but there are those who are saying that a macroeconomic perspective of the can yield different results . on the other side of the fence there business leaders and economists who asserted that immigrant workers can be a boon to the us economy . they their assertion with research findings that the impact of immigration “ are to disentangle from other factors that have dampened wage growth for most workers in recent decades , including new technologies , the in manufacturing jobs , the drop in unionization , globalization and recessions ” ( henderson 1 ) . in other words it is to immigrant workers because they are highly visible but if one uses a more scientific approach to the the results are surprising . #

They're Phds from Oxbridge here, people who have topped their year group at Oxford. A really talented London bunch.

They're neither pro nor anti-immigration, they recognise that it can objectively be good and bad, but mostly the net effect of having a migration surplus is strong economic growth. It's what makes our companies successful.

Attracting talented productive immigrants boosts our economies and strengthens our economy.

  
Yet, yesterday. I dug into 20+ reddit profiles who were defending Starmer's decision to change ILR retroactively from 5 to 10 years (not confirmed yet but they're hinting at this).

This massively affects this group of people who, ontop of having to the HCOL in London, pay an extra £1500 to be here. We don't get access to any public funds either.   
  
And it's £1500 per dependent. My Czech friend who is one of the top Quantum computing researchers right now has a wife and 2 kids. That's going to cost him an extra £6000 a year in VISA, IHS fees. He's said he's going to rent out his flat and move back to Europe (possibly Germany or Switzerland) if this change is made retroactively.

We are going to lose so much talent because of this! And tax money too. 

But my point is, so many on the left are now supporting this inhumane decision. I looked at so many reddit profiles who support this decision, and they were all stauch defenders of migrants, some even up to a week ago.

  
Making a change like this is going to change voting patterns significantly. The south asian communities in London are growing and they're all becoming more and more anti labour, this will be the nail in the coffin for Labour in so many London seats.

  
This honestly feels like a Pysop, because if feels like if Reform came out and said, we support skilled labour (which they have said) migration and just want to curb illegals and low skilled workers, they'd win by a landslide.

Are redditors that daft that they turn almost 'racist' and hateful towards immigrants because their party says so?

I'm in a huge network of whatsapp groups and meetups that are 70-80% . A lot are from Eastern Europe and South Asia primarily, though they're a few Americans, Caribbean, Africans, Aussies/Kiwis here too.

They're all massively talented, quite a few have launched successful tech startups and sold it (often to American companies) for Millions.

They're Phds from Oxbridge here, people who have topped their year group at Oxford. A really talented London bunch.

They're neither pro nor anti-immigration, they recognise that it can objectively be good and bad, but mostly the net effect of having a migration surplus is strong  growth. It's what makes our companies successful.

Attracting talented productive  boosts our economies and strengthens our economy.

  
Yet, yesterday. I dug into 20+ reddit profiles who were defending Starmer's decision to change ILR retroactively from 5 to 10 years (not confirmed yet but they're hinting at this).

This massively affects this group of people who, ontop of having to the HCOL in London, pay an extra £1500 to be here. We don't get access to any public funds either.   
  
And it's £1500 per dependent. My Czech friend who is one of the top Quantum computing researchers  now has a wife and 2 kids. That's going to cost him an extra £6000 a year in VISA, IHS fees. He's said he's going to rent out his flat and move back to Europe (possibly Germany or Switzerland) if this change is made retroactively.

We are going to lose so much talent because of this! And tax money too. 

But my point is, so many on the left are now supporting this inhumane decision. I looked at so many reddit profiles who support this decision, and they were all stauch defenders of migrants, some even up to a week ago.

  
Making a change like this is going to change voting patterns significantly. The south asian communities in London are growing and they're all becoming more and more anti labour, this will be the nail in the coffin for Labour in so many London seats.

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1kmhpp8/effort_post_why_labours_new_immigration_policy_is/,Immigration is bad for the economy,Effort Post - Why Labour’s new immigration policy is self-defeating,"Following Keir Starmer’s speech and the unveiling of the new immigration white paper on Monday, I thought I would log on to reddit to find some validation for my opinions: namely, that his rhetoric was morally repugnant, that the policy was economically moronic and that there would be next to no political benefit for the Labour party. Knowing the state of the UK subreddits, I came straight to r/neoliberal, only to find that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1kkj1dp/uk_plans_to_end_failed_free_market_experiment_in/) too the majority opinion was that this was a sensible, even necessary move. There wasn’t quite the same nativism on show as on r/ukpolitics, more the sense that though it might not be ‘comfortable’ to pander to the nativist right, the local election results and recent polling show that Britain is essentially a nation of racists and you have to do what you have to do to win.

In my view this is entirely incorrect. I have laid out my reasoning below, focusing on why the rhetoric is unacceptable, especially from the leader of a nominally centre-left party, why these changes will have adverse effects and why they likely won’t change how people vote anyway.

**Effects**

There are a number of ways that arbitrarily reducing the net migration number is harmful to the economic wellbeing of a country. I’ll primarily focus on two of the most pertinent to the UK: the care home sector and universities as this post is already way too long though I could also have included points about construction, research and AI.

*Social Care*

Social Care has been perhaps the major political issue in the UK (other than immigration) for the past twenty years. Because of the way social care is organised in this country (see [here](https://benansell.substack.com/p/profiles-in-discourage) for a good breakdown since the 90s), there have been outsize adverse effects on both the NHS, overall health and local infrastructure. The NHS is affected in the main because there are not enough [funded care spaces for the elderly who are well enough to leave hospital](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2024/09/11/dire-state-of-social-care-among-reasons-nhs-is-in-disrepair-adviser-tells-government/). Local infrastructure is affected because councils are required to fund care locally rather than nationally; many councils spend well over [50% of their budget on social care](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0rqndglv5lo), leading to bankruptcies, brutally cut services and crumbling infrastructure. With such financial pressures, the care home industry is something of a race to the bottom. Pay and conditions are poor which is reflected in both the [vacancy rate](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/long-reads/social-care-360-workforce-carers) and the very high number of immigrants who work in [the sector](https://www.workrightscentre.org/news/the-forgotten-third-migrant-workers-views-on-improving-conditions-in-englands-adult-social-care-sector) (32% in 2024), many of whom were recruited in targeted advertisements world wide. 

Clearly the current situation is not ideal. Relying on exploited, badly paid, vulnerable immigrants to prop up care for the elderly is not an endpoint or something that should be celebrated. It seems obvious to me, however, that the first point of call to both fix the current crisis and, in the long term, reduce care worker immigration, is to reform funding and delivery. Theresa May’s travails in 2017 killed off any hope of new taxes, whilst reform to delivery will have to wait until [2028](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-commission-into-adult-social-care-terms-of-reference/independent-commission-into-adult-social-care-terms-of-reference#:~:text=terms%2Dof%2Dreference-,Summary,2028%20to%20the%20Prime%20Minister.) (and likely beyond). In the meantime, according to the white paper, the government plans to close applications to social care visas from abroad and, by 2028, remove the possibility to extend visas for those already in the UK. 

To do this without any meaningful change to the way social care works or is funded is not just irresponsible. It is a dereliction of duty. 

1. There is an ever growing increase in demand for social care. Despite this, the actual amount of money that can be spent is finite because of the current funding model. Adding the supply shock of an increased labour shortage to this mix can only lead to more elderly unable to find a suitable home.
2. As a result of this, the NHS will end up looking after even more elderly patients who do not need to be in a hospital, swallowing up the additional money thrown into the Health Service.
3. Councils will continue to go bankrupt. Public provision will continue to decline.

*Universities*

Universities have been one of the great UK success stories over the past 20 years. Yet, similar to the creative industries there seems to be very little appreciation of how central they have become to the country and the local economy. Per this [recent study](https://www.publicfirst.co.uk/global-talent-local-growth-the-export-and-jobs-benefit-of-international-students-in-the-uk.html#:~:text=The%20gross%20export%20value%20of,are%20currently%20held%20by%20Labour.) in 26 constituencies in the country, higher education is the single largest export sector, supporting 183,000 jobs. It is in the top 3 sectors in 102 constituencies. Simply walk around any mid-size city or town and you will see immediately just how much economic activity derives from a university, or how little is present in those which lack one. They are probably the closest analogy we have in the country today to the steel mills and coal mines of the 20th century-- and the same kind of economic fallout will occur if they close. 

The measures relating to student visas in the white paper are not as drastic as the measures to cap social care visas, mainly focusing on students claiming asylum after completing their degree and lessening the length of a graduate visa from two years to eighteen months. The mention, however, of a “levy on higher education provider income from international students” is deeply concerning. This would essentially be a self-imposed export tariff, reducing the competitiveness of the UK industry at a time when it is in crisis. Frozen tuition fees and lack of public funding means many universities are already [financially struggling](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/labour-mps-sound-alarm-new-international-student-rules), and already [falling international student numbers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgwwgl2nleo) are not going help.

If the government is actually serious about British growth and enterprise it needs to be serious about supporting recruitment of international students and not placing new hurdles in their way-- especially ones which don’t have any [public support](https://www.britishfuture.org/public-supports-immigration-from-international-students-finds-new-study/).

**Politics**

Despite Keir Starmer's and Yvette Cooper's claims, it seems clear that, rhetorically at least, the anti-immigration pivot from Labour is an attempt to halt the rise of Nigel Farage and Reform. I do not believe this will work for a number of reasons. Each of the below points are arguable, however I think taken as a whole they show that these measures, and anti-immigration sentiment in general by a left wing party, is not a panacea against the far right.

*1. Public services will continue to get worse and economic growth will be impacted.*

As illustrated in my example above: if we see a worsening of the social care crisis due to cuts in immigration there will be a concomitant worsening of local services, i.e. the place where the majority of the public interact with the government and the NHS will continue to struggle. Likewise, a lack of growth, due to contractions in the university or construction industries for example, will mean lower tax receipts and additional cuts to public spending.

Labour were voted in under the promise to improve public services and any failure in this regard will be seen as a betrayal. Just the amount of [backlash and pressure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0xee5krnno) that has come to reverse the means testing of the Winter Fuel Allowance shows how little rope Labour have with voters.

*2. The level of immigration is already decreasing significantly.*

The extremely high level of immigration from 2021 to 2023 was due in large part to the flows of refugees from Afghanistan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. The level of net migration is already [falling significantly](https://www.britishfuture.org/the-politics-of-immigration-lag-behind-the-reality-of-falling-numbers/) due to these inflows reducing and the measures taken by the Conservatives in [2023](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-12-04/debates/921A08A2-F615-48F2-8C56-423A29556F9F/LegalMigration). Labour do not need to make further concessions. They simply need to look and point at a chart in 2027 or so and say ‘look what we did’.

*3. Political salience is a thing.*

Raising a topic to the forefront of public conversation in which you [are weak](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/05/12/25492/1) is not a good idea in politics. By raising immigration to the forefront of the public consciousness, instead of, say, pushing hard on anti-NIMBYism and pro-Ukraine (both negative areas for Reform), you are most likely to simply remind voters that they do not trust you. As has been noted many times, parties which chase the far right have not been historically successful. However, if you instead look at places where left wing parties have done better, such as Australia where net immigration numbers are actually higher per capita, immigration was not a high priority topic in large part because the Albanese government simply didn’t engage with the issues [at all](https://bsky.app/profile/sundersays.bsky.social/post/3lodfkqmfos2x).

4. The number of voters persuadable on immigration is very small.

The vast majority of current [Reform voters hate Labour and want nothing to do with them](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52134-where-do-britons-stand-on-possible-coalitions). Likewise, the number of [Reform curious Labour voters is small](https://bsky.app/profile/dylandifford.bsky.social/post/3loejqs7p222t). Indeed, it seems likely that a number of the voters [Labour are targeting are already dead](https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/04/09/zombie-politics-how-dead-man-dominates-british-politics).

The realignment of the Labour coalition is essentially complete. The vast majority of 2024 Labour voters have a [positive view of immigration](https://www.britishfuture.org/publication/restoring-trust-in-polarised-times-immigration-in-the-new-parliament/). Ignoring these voters to chase after a very small percentage of Labour to Reform movers risks alienating your base, depressing turnout and losing votes to the Lib Dems and Greens.

*5. The next election will come down to tactical voting and squeezing.*

The Labour vote in 2024 was [extremely efficient](https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/understanding-the-most-disproportionate-uk-election/)\-- as was the Lib Dem vote. This was in the main due to tactical voting to get the Tories out and a split of the right wing vote (as an example, see [this result](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2024/uk/constituencies/E14001401) where the Lib Dem vote reduced from the previous election despite their national increase because voters perceived only Labour could win).

In 2029 this will likely become even more important, especially if, as polling shows, the Green/LD/Labour block is roughly equal with Reform/Conservatives and there is more awareness of this kind of tactical voting on the right. If even a small number of Lib Dem and Green voters are so repulsed by Labour’s anti-immigration rhetoric that they refuse to be squeezed into the Labour camp, it could have quite large repercussions.

*6. The next election is 4 years away!*

A lot can change between now and 2029. This is the kind of move a desperate party makes with a year to go. All it does is reduce room for manoeuvre. 

**Morality**

I’ve covered the economic and political reasons why the new immigration white paper is a bad idea. However, I think it’s important not to simply view the world as a kind of min/max game but to also consider the increasingly unfashionable concepts of morality and ‘good’, especially with the content of Keir Starmer’s speech on Monday and the foreword to the white paper.

Perhaps, as has been suggested, Starmer was channeling *Bowling Alone* with his “island of strangers” comment. On balance, however, the fact that he also states the last few years were a “squalid chapter” of “open borders” means I am not really open to giving him the benefit of the doubt. Coming less than twelve months after what were [essentially pogroms](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/04/rioters-try-to-torch-rotherham-asylum-seeker-hotel-amid-far-right-violence) against asylum seekers, is it not considered important for the Prime Minister to take care with his language? Or is it more important to dog whistle for a 2% bump in the polls? It is utterly cynical. And if Starmer continues down this nativist path it will provide cover for racists and far-right extremists to make far more explicit statements and take far more explicit actions.

Equally morally repugnant, in my view, is Keir Starmer’s denigration of those who moved to this country over the past few years, quite literally at our invitation. In his foreword to the white paper he states that “the damage \[a policy of open borders\] has done to our country is incalculable”. Immigrants are referred to as ‘cheap labour’, with no mention of the fact that they are the only thing to have kept the social care system afloat or provided billions to the economy. Perhaps a word of thanks might be in order?

It’s actually remarkably similar to how the immigrants to the UK in the 60s were treated: brought to Britain from across the Empire/Commonwealth to fill worker shortages under the impression that they would be welcomed as British citizens, only to find themselves confronted by racism and blamed for all sorts of social ills. I can only imagine how horrific it must be to have been sold the dream of a life in the UK, only to be [trapped and exploited](https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-hundreds-more-migrant-care-workers-facing-exploitation-070325) whilst [regularly subjected to racism](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2024/03/15/minority-ethnic-social-workers-face-disproportionately-high-levels-of-bullying-and-disciplinaries-study/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%202021%20survey,enough%20to%20tackle%20the%20problem.), and now to be told that not only are you no longer wanted, but that somehow the majority of the issues in this country are your fault.

",hutyluty,neoliberal,In-favor,Immigration,"Effort Post - Why Labour’s new immigration policy is self-defeating Following Keir Starmer’s speech and the unveiling of the new immigration white paper on Monday, I thought I would log on to reddit to find some validation for my opinions: namely, that his rhetoric was morally repugnant, that the policy was economically moronic and that there would be next to no political benefit for the Labour party. Knowing the state of the UK subreddits, I came straight to r/neoliberal, only to find that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1kkj1dp/uk_plans_to_end_failed_free_market_experiment_in/) too the majority opinion was that this was a sensible, even necessary move. There wasn’t quite the same nativism on show as on r/ukpolitics, more the sense that though it might not be ‘comfortable’ to pander to the nativist right, the local election results and recent polling show that Britain is essentially a nation of racists and you have to do what you have to do to win.

In my view this is entirely incorrect. I have laid out my reasoning below, focusing on why the rhetoric is unacceptable, especially from the leader of a nominally centre-left party, why these changes will have adverse effects and why they likely won’t change how people vote anyway.

**Effects**

There are a number of ways that arbitrarily reducing the net migration number is harmful to the economic wellbeing of a country. I’ll primarily focus on two of the most pertinent to the UK: the care home sector and universities as this post is already way too long though I could also have included points about construction, research and AI.

*Social Care*

Social Care has been perhaps the major political issue in the UK (other than immigration) for the past twenty years. Because of the way social care is organised in this country (see [here](https://benansell.substack.com/p/profiles-in-discourage) for a good breakdown since the 90s), there have been outsize adverse effects on both the NHS, overall health and local infrastructure. The NHS is affected in the main because there are not enough [funded care spaces for the elderly who are well enough to leave hospital](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2024/09/11/dire-state-of-social-care-among-reasons-nhs-is-in-disrepair-adviser-tells-government/). Local infrastructure is affected because councils are required to fund care locally rather than nationally; many councils spend well over [50% of their budget on social care](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0rqndglv5lo), leading to bankruptcies, brutally cut services and crumbling infrastructure. With such financial pressures, the care home industry is something of a race to the bottom. Pay and conditions are poor which is reflected in both the [vacancy rate](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/long-reads/social-care-360-workforce-carers) and the very high number of immigrants who work in [the sector](https://www.workrightscentre.org/news/the-forgotten-third-migrant-workers-views-on-improving-conditions-in-englands-adult-social-care-sector) (32% in 2024), many of whom were recruited in targeted advertisements world wide. 

Clearly the current situation is not ideal. Relying on exploited, badly paid, vulnerable immigrants to prop up care for the elderly is not an endpoint or something that should be celebrated. It seems obvious to me, however, that the first point of call to both fix the current crisis and, in the long term, reduce care worker immigration, is to reform funding and delivery. Theresa May’s travails in 2017 killed off any hope of new taxes, whilst reform to delivery will have to wait until [2028](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-commission-into-adult-social-care-terms-of-reference/independent-commission-into-adult-social-care-terms-of-reference#:~:text=terms%2Dof%2Dreference-,Summary,2028%20to%20the%20Prime%20Minister.) (and likely beyond). In the meantime, according to the white paper, the government plans to close applications to social care visas from abroad and, by 2028, remove the possibility to extend visas for those already in the UK. 

To do this without any meaningful change to the way social care works or is funded is not just irresponsible. It is a dereliction of duty. 

1. There is an ever growing increase in demand for social care. Despite this, the actual amount of money that can be spent is finite because of the current funding model. Adding the supply shock of an increased labour shortage to this mix can only lead to more elderly unable to find a suitable home.
2. As a result of this, the NHS will end up looking after even more elderly patients who do not need to be in a hospital, swallowing up the additional money thrown into the Health Service.
3. Councils will continue to go bankrupt. Public provision will continue to decline.

*Universities*

Universities have been one of the great UK success stories over the past 20 years. Yet, similar to the creative industries there seems to be very little appreciation of how central they have become to the country and the local economy. Per this [recent study](https://www.publicfirst.co.uk/global-talent-local-growth-the-export-and-jobs-benefit-of-international-students-in-the-uk.html#:~:text=The%20gross%20export%20value%20of,are%20currently%20held%20by%20Labour.) in 26 constituencies in the country, higher education is the single largest export sector, supporting 183,000 jobs. It is in the top 3 sectors in 102 constituencies. Simply walk around any mid-size city or town and you will see immediately just how much economic activity derives from a university, or how little is present in those which lack one. They are probably the closest analogy we have in the country today to the steel mills and coal mines of the 20th century-- and the same kind of economic fallout will occur if they close. 

The measures relating to student visas in the white paper are not as drastic as the measures to cap social care visas, mainly focusing on students claiming asylum after completing their degree and lessening the length of a graduate visa from two years to eighteen months. The mention, however, of a “levy on higher education provider income from international students” is deeply concerning. This would essentially be a self-imposed export tariff, reducing the competitiveness of the UK industry at a time when it is in crisis. Frozen tuition fees and lack of public funding means many universities are already [financially struggling](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/labour-mps-sound-alarm-new-international-student-rules), and already [falling international student numbers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgwwgl2nleo) are not going help.

If the government is actually serious about British growth and enterprise it needs to be serious about supporting recruitment of international students and not placing new hurdles in their way-- especially ones which don’t have any [public support](https://www.britishfuture.org/public-supports-immigration-from-international-students-finds-new-study/).

**Politics**

Despite Keir Starmer's and Yvette Cooper's claims, it seems clear that, rhetorically at least, the anti-immigration pivot from Labour is an attempt to halt the rise of Nigel Farage and Reform. I do not believe this will work for a number of reasons. Each of the below points are arguable, however I think taken as a whole they show that these measures, and anti-immigration sentiment in general by a left wing party, is not a panacea against the far right.

*1. Public services will continue to get worse and economic growth will be impacted.*

As illustrated in my example above: if we see a worsening of the social care crisis due to cuts in immigration there will be a concomitant worsening of local services, i.e. the place where the majority of the public interact with the government and the NHS will continue to struggle. Likewise, a lack of growth, due to contractions in the university or construction industries for example, will mean lower tax receipts and additional cuts to public spending.

Labour were voted in under the promise to improve public services and any failure in this regard will be seen as a betrayal. Just the amount of [backlash and pressure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0xee5krnno) that has come to reverse the means testing of the Winter Fuel Allowance shows how little rope Labour have with voters.

*2. The level of immigration is already decreasing significantly.*

The extremely high level of immigration from 2021 to 2023 was due in large part to the flows of refugees from Afghanistan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. The level of net migration is already [falling significantly](https://www.britishfuture.org/the-politics-of-immigration-lag-behind-the-reality-of-falling-numbers/) due to these inflows reducing and the measures taken by the Conservatives in [2023](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-12-04/debates/921A08A2-F615-48F2-8C56-423A29556F9F/LegalMigration). Labour do not need to make further concessions. They simply need to look and point at a chart in 2027 or so and say ‘look what we did’.

*3. Political salience is a thing.*

Raising a topic to the forefront of public conversation in which you [are weak](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/05/12/25492/1) is not a good idea in politics. By raising immigration to the forefront of the public consciousness, instead of, say, pushing hard on anti-NIMBYism and pro-Ukraine (both negative areas for Reform), you are most likely to simply remind voters that they do not trust you. As has been noted many times, parties which chase the far right have not been historically successful. However, if you instead look at places where left wing parties have done better, such as Australia where net immigration numbers are actually higher per capita, immigration was not a high priority topic in large part because the Albanese government simply didn’t engage with the issues [at all](https://bsky.app/profile/sundersays.bsky.social/post/3lodfkqmfos2x).

4. The number of voters persuadable on immigration is very small.

The vast majority of current [Reform voters hate Labour and want nothing to do with them](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52134-where-do-britons-stand-on-possible-coalitions). Likewise, the number of [Reform curious Labour voters is small](https://bsky.app/profile/dylandifford.bsky.social/post/3loejqs7p222t). Indeed, it seems likely that a number of the voters [Labour are targeting are already dead](https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/04/09/zombie-politics-how-dead-man-dominates-british-politics).

The realignment of the Labour coalition is essentially complete. The vast majority of 2024 Labour voters have a [positive view of immigration](https://www.britishfuture.org/publication/restoring-trust-in-polarised-times-immigration-in-the-new-parliament/). Ignoring these voters to chase after a very small percentage of Labour to Reform movers risks alienating your base, depressing turnout and losing votes to the Lib Dems and Greens.

*5. The next election will come down to tactical voting and squeezing.*

The Labour vote in 2024 was [extremely efficient](https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/understanding-the-most-disproportionate-uk-election/)\-- as was the Lib Dem vote. This was in the main due to tactical voting to get the Tories out and a split of the right wing vote (as an example, see [this result](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2024/uk/constituencies/E14001401) where the Lib Dem vote reduced from the previous election despite their national increase because voters perceived only Labour could win).

In 2029 this will likely become even more important, especially if, as polling shows, the Green/LD/Labour block is roughly equal with Reform/Conservatives and there is more awareness of this kind of tactical voting on the right. If even a small number of Lib Dem and Green voters are so repulsed by Labour’s anti-immigration rhetoric that they refuse to be squeezed into the Labour camp, it could have quite large repercussions.

*6. The next election is 4 years away!*

A lot can change between now and 2029. This is the kind of move a desperate party makes with a year to go. All it does is reduce room for manoeuvre. 

**Morality**

I’ve covered the economic and political reasons why the new immigration white paper is a bad idea. However, I think it’s important not to simply view the world as a kind of min/max game but to also consider the increasingly unfashionable concepts of morality and ‘good’, especially with the content of Keir Starmer’s speech on Monday and the foreword to the white paper.

Perhaps, as has been suggested, Starmer was channeling *Bowling Alone* with his “island of strangers” comment. On balance, however, the fact that he also states the last few years were a “squalid chapter” of “open borders” means I am not really open to giving him the benefit of the doubt. Coming less than twelve months after what were [essentially pogroms](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/04/rioters-try-to-torch-rotherham-asylum-seeker-hotel-amid-far-right-violence) against asylum seekers, is it not considered important for the Prime Minister to take care with his language? Or is it more important to dog whistle for a 2% bump in the polls? It is utterly cynical. And if Starmer continues down this nativist path it will provide cover for racists and far-right extremists to make far more explicit statements and take far more explicit actions.

Equally morally repugnant, in my view, is Keir Starmer’s denigration of those who moved to this country over the past few years, quite literally at our invitation. In his foreword to the white paper he states that “the damage \[a policy of open borders\] has done to our country is incalculable”. Immigrants are referred to as ‘cheap labour’, with no mention of the fact that they are the only thing to have kept the social care system afloat or provided billions to the economy. Perhaps a word of thanks might be in order?

It’s actually remarkably similar to how the immigrants to the UK in the 60s were treated: brought to Britain from across the Empire/Commonwealth to fill worker shortages under the impression that they would be welcomed as British citizens, only to find themselves confronted by racism and blamed for all sorts of social ills. I can only imagine how horrific it must be to have been sold the dream of a life in the UK, only to be [trapped and exploited](https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-hundreds-more-migrant-care-workers-facing-exploitation-070325) whilst [regularly subjected to racism](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2024/03/15/minority-ethnic-social-workers-face-disproportionately-high-levels-of-bullying-and-disciplinaries-study/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%202021%20survey,enough%20to%20tackle%20the%20problem.), and now to be told that not only are you no longer wanted, but that somehow the majority of the issues in this country are your fault.

There wasn’t quite the same nativism on show as on r/ukpolitics, more the sense that though it might not be ‘comfortable’ to pander to the nativist , the local election results and recent polling show that Britain is essentially a nation of racists and you have to do what you have to do to win.

In my view this is entirely incorrect. I have laid out my reasoning below, focusing on why the rhetoric is unacceptable, especially from the leader of a nominally centre-left party, why these changes will have adverse effects and why they likely won’t change how people vote anyway.

**Effects**

There are a number of ways that arbitrarily reducing the net migration number is harmful to the  wellbeing of a country. I’ll primarily focus on two of the most pertinent to the UK: the care home sector and universities as this post is already way too long though I could also have included points about construction, research and AI.

*Social Care*

Social Care has been perhaps the major political issue in the UK (other than immigration) for the past twenty years. Because of the way social care is organised in this country (see [here](https://benansell.substack.com/p/profiles-in-discourage) for a good breakdown since the 90s), there have been outsize adverse effects on both the NHS, overall health and local . The NHS is affected in the main because there are not enough [funded care spaces for the elderly who are well enough to leave hospital](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2024/09/11/dire-state-of-social-care-among-reasons-nhs-is-in-disrepair-adviser-tells-government/). Local  is affected because councils are required to fund care locally rather than nationally; many councils spend well over [50% of their budget on social care](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0rqndglv5lo), leading to bankruptcies, brutally cut services and crumbling . With such financial pressures, the care home industry is something of a race to the bottom. Pay and conditions are poor which is reflected in both the [vacancy rate](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/long-reads/social-care-360-workforce-carers) and the very high number of  who work in [the sector](https://www.workrightscentre.org/news/the-forgotten-third-migrant-workers-views-on-improving-conditions-in-englands-adult-social-care-sector) (32% in 2024), many of whom were recruited in targeted advertisements world wide. 

Clearly the current situation is not ideal. Relying on exploited, badly paid, vulnerable  to prop up care for the elderly is not an endpoint or something that should be celebrated. It seems obvious to me, however, that the first point of call to both fix the current crisis and, in the long term, reduce care worker immigration, is to reform funding and delivery. Theresa May’s travails in 2017 killed off any hope of new taxes, whilst reform to delivery will have to wait until [2028](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-commission-into-adult-social-care-terms-of-reference/independent-commission-into-adult-social-care-terms-of-reference#:~:text=terms%2Dof%2Dreference-,Summary,2028%20to%20the%20Prime%20Minister.) (and likely beyond). In the meantime, according to the white paper, the government plans to close applications to social care visas from abroad and, by 2028, remove the possibility to extend visas for those already in the UK. 

To do this without any meaningful change to the way social care works or is funded is not just irresponsible. It is a dereliction of duty. 

1. There is an ever growing increase in demand for social care. Despite this, the actual amount of money that can be spent is finite because of the current funding model. Adding the supply shock of an increased labour shortage to this mix can only lead to more elderly unable to find a suitable home.
2. As a result of this, the NHS will end up looking after even more elderly patients who do not need to be in a hospital, swallowing up the additional money thrown into the Health Service.
3. Councils will continue to go bankrupt. Public provision will continue to decline.

*Universities*

Universities have been one of the great UK success stories over the past 20 years. Yet, similar to the creative industries there seems to be very little appreciation of how central they have become to the country and the local economy. Per this [recent study](https://www.publicfirst.co.uk/global-talent-local-growth-the-export-and-jobs-benefit-of-international-students-in-the-uk.html#:~:text=The%20gross%20export%20value%20of,are%20currently%20held%20by%20Labour.) in 26 constituencies in the country, higher education is the single largest export sector, supporting 183,000 jobs. It is in the top 3 sectors in 102 constituencies. Simply walk around any mid-size city or town and you will see immediately just how much  activity derives from a university, or how little is present in those which lack one. They are probably the closest analogy we have in the country today to the steel mills and coal mines of the 20th century-- and the same kind of  fallout will occur if they close. 

The measures relating to student visas in the white paper are not as drastic as the measures to cap social care visas, mainly focusing on students claiming asylum after completing their degree and lessening the length of a graduate visa from two years to eighteen months. The mention, however, of a “levy on higher education provider income from international students” is deeply concerning. This would essentially be a self-imposed export tariff, reducing the competitiveness of the UK industry at a time when it is in crisis. Frozen tuition fees and lack of public funding means many universities are already [financially struggling](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/labour-mps-sound-alarm-new-international-student-rules), and already [falling international student numbers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgwwgl2nleo) are not going help.

If the government is actually serious about British growth and enterprise it needs to be serious about supporting recruitment of international students and not placing new hurdles in their way-- especially ones which don’t have any [public support](https://www.britishfuture.org/public-supports-immigration-from-international-students-finds-new-study/).

**Politics**

Despite Keir Starmer's and Yvette Cooper's claims, it seems clear that, rhetorically at least, the anti-immigration pivot from Labour is an attempt to halt the rise of Nigel Farage and Reform. I do not believe this will work for a number of reasons. Each of the below points are arguable, however I think taken as a whole they show that these measures, and anti-immigration sentiment in general by a left  party, is not a panacea against the far .

*1. Public services will continue to get worse and  growth will be impacted.*

As illustrated in my example above: if we see a worsening of the social care crisis due to cuts in immigration there will be a concomitant worsening of local services, i.e. the place where the majority of the public interact with the government and the NHS will continue to struggle. Likewise, a lack of growth, due to contractions in the university or construction industries for example, will mean lower tax receipts and additional cuts to public spending.

Labour were voted in under the promise to improve public services and any failure in this regard will be seen as a betrayal. Just the amount of [backlash and pressure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0xee5krnno) that has come to reverse the means testing of the Winter Fuel Allowance shows how little rope Labour have with voters.

*2. The level of immigration is already decreasing significantly.*

The extremely high level of immigration from 2021 to 2023 was due in large part to the flows of refugees from Afghanistan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. The level of net migration is already [falling significantly](https://www.britishfuture.org/the-politics-of-immigration-lag-behind-the-reality-of-falling-numbers/) due to these inflows reducing and the measures taken by the Conservatives in [2023](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-12-04/debates/921A08A2-F615-48F2-8C56-423A29556F9F/LegalMigration). Labour do not need to make further concessions. They simply need to look and point at a chart in 2027 or so and say ‘look what we did’.

*3. Political salience is a thing.*

Raising a topic to the forefront of public conversation in which you [are weak](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/05/12/25492/1) is not a good idea in politics. By raising immigration to the forefront of the public consciousness, instead of, say, pushing hard on anti-NIMBYism and pro-Ukraine (both negative areas for Reform), you are most likely to simply remind voters that they do not trust you. As has been noted many times, parties which chase the far  have not been historically successful. However, if you instead look at places where left  parties have done better, such as Australia where net immigration numbers are actually higher per capita, immigration was not a high priority topic in large part because the Albanese government simply didn’t engage with the issues [at all](https://bsky.app/profile/sundersays.bsky.social/post/3lodfkqmfos2x).

4. The number of voters persuadable on immigration is very small.

The vast majority of current [Reform voters hate Labour and want nothing to do with them](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52134-where-do-britons-stand-on-possible-coalitions). Likewise, the number of [Reform curious Labour voters is small](https://bsky.app/profile/dylandifford.bsky.social/post/3loejqs7p222t). Indeed, it seems likely that a number of the voters [Labour are targeting are already dead](https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/04/09/zombie-politics-how-dead-man-dominates-british-politics).

The realignment of the Labour coalition is essentially complete. The vast majority of 2024 Labour voters have a [positive view of immigration](https://www.britishfuture.org/publication/restoring-trust-in-polarised-times-immigration-in-the-new-parliament/). Ignoring these voters to chase after a very small percentage of Labour to Reform movers risks alienating your base, depressing turnout and losing votes to the Lib Dems and Greens.

*5. The next election will come down to tactical voting and squeezing.*

The Labour vote in 2024 was [extremely efficient](https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/understanding-the-most-disproportionate-uk-election/)\-- as was the Lib Dem vote. This was in the main due to tactical voting to get the Tories out and a split of the   vote (as an example, see [this result](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2024/uk/constituencies/E14001401) where the Lib Dem vote reduced from the previous election despite their national increase because voters perceived only Labour could win).

In 2029 this will likely become even more important, especially if, as polling shows, the Green/LD/Labour block is roughly equal with Reform/Conservatives and there is more awareness of this kind of tactical voting on the . If even a small number of Lib Dem and Green voters are so repulsed by Labour’s anti-immigration rhetoric that they refuse to be squeezed into the Labour camp, it could have quite large repercussions.

*6. The next election is 4 years away!*

A lot can change between now and 2029. This is the kind of move a desperate party makes with a year to go. All it does is reduce room for manoeuvre. 

**Morality**

I’ve covered the  and political reasons why the new immigration white paper is a bad idea. However, I think it’s important not to simply view the world as a kind of min/max game but to also consider the increasingly unfashionable concepts of morality and ‘good’, especially with the content of Keir Starmer’s speech on Monday and the foreword to the white paper.

Perhaps, as has been suggested, Starmer was channeling *Bowling Alone* with his “island of strangers” comment. On balance, however, the fact that he also states the last few years were a “squalid chapter” of “open borders” means I am not really open to giving him the benefit of the doubt. Coming less than twelve months after what were [essentially pogroms](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/04/rioters-try-to-torch-rotherham-asylum-seeker-hotel-amid-far--violence) against asylum seekers, is it not considered important for the Prime Minister to take care with his language? Or is it more important to dog whistle for a 2% bump in the polls? It is utterly cynical. And if Starmer continues down this nativist path it will provide cover for racists and far- extremists to make far more explicit statements and take far more explicit actions.

Equally morally repugnant, in my view, is Keir Starmer’s denigration of those who moved to this country over the past few years, quite literally at our invitation. In his foreword to the white paper he states that “the damage \[a policy of open borders\] has done to our country is incalculable”.  are referred to as ‘cheap labour’, with no mention of the fact that they are the only thing to have kept the social care system afloat or provided billions to the economy. Perhaps a word of thanks might be in order?

It’s actually remarkably similar to how the  to the UK in the 60s were treated: brought to Britain from across the Empire/Commonwealth to fill worker shortages under the impression that they would be welcomed as British citizens, only to find themselves confronted by racism and blamed for all sorts of social ills. I can only imagine how horrific it must be to have been sold the dream of a life in the UK, only to be [trapped and exploited](https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-hundreds-more-migrant-care-workers-facing-exploitation-070325) whilst [regularly subjected to racism](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2024/03/15/minority-ethnic-social-workers-face-disproportionately-high-levels-of-bullying-and-disciplinaries-study/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%202021%20survey,enough%20to%20tackle%20the%20problem.), and now to be told that not only are you no longer wanted, but that somehow the majority of the issues in this country are your fault.

There is always going to be a balancing act between Democratic Socialists, Trade Unionists, Social Democrats, and yes Orange Liberals.

There are three main grassroots movements that should be uniting all of us.

First the Labour Movement - The vehicle of liberation for the working class.

The Labour Movement has given us minimum wages, overtime pay, workplace safety standards, maternity and parental leave, vacation pay, and protection from discrimination and harassment.

In countries with stronger leftist presences it has provided 15-21 paid sick days provided by employer per year as a BASE (Before national insurance programs even kick in).  It has delivered 30 hour or less work weeks (Currently also studying and implementing four-day work weeks), an average of 1300 annual labour hours and still trending downwards, national sectoral bargaining to strengthen the pay, benefits, rights, and protections of hard to unionize environments (Also strengthens Unions overall), codified rights and protections in regards to work from home/remote work options, and so forth and so forth.

The Environmentalist Movement which has alerted the populace to how bad the climate crisis and in general environmental crisis really is (We are in the sixth mass extinction event on planet earth... The Holocene Extinction).  Additionally the climate crisis poses an existential threat to our species in under 100 years.  The Environmentalist Movement has shown if we put our time, energy, and resources into new perspectives and polices we can redo how we go about Energy, Infrastructure, and overall Technology!  We as a species arise from the natural world and the natural world sustain us.  The natural world is not the enemy of affordability of life/quality of life like some morons are pushing.

The Civil Rights Movement - Both historically and in modern times this is a movement that has fought for the equality of people on countless fronts!

These and other dimensions of thought/action unite people of sound and mature mind.

I really believe the Leap Manifesto, a more hardline Labour Movement emphasis, and the themes of ""Economic Democracy"" that Matthew Green spoke so passionately about is how to create a cohesive identity for the party in which to move forward on.

The Leap Manifesto is summed up as:

1. Fully implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
2. A shift to a ""100% clean energy economy"" by 2050
3. A moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure projects
4. Support for community-owned clean energy projects
5. A universal program for energy efficiency and retrofitting, prioritizing low income communities
6. High-speed rail and affordable, nation-wide public transit
7. Re-training and resources for workers in carbon-intensive industries
8. A national infrastructure-renewal program
9. An overhaul of the agricultural industry, prioritizing local production
10. A moratorium on international trade deals that infringe upon democratic rights
11. Immigration status and full legal protection for all workers, including immigrants and refugees
12. Investment in expanding ""low-carbon"" sectors of the economy, including through the development of a national childcare program
13. A ""vigorous debate"" on the implementation of a universal basic income
14. An end to austerity and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, paid for with cuts to military spending and robust progressive, wealth, and corporate taxation
15. An end to corporate funding of political campaigns and examination of voting reform

It’s frustrating living in the USA where so many people confuse culture war distractions with actual infrastructure policy. Real infrastructure isn’t about immigration debates, crime statistics, or vague calls to “stop corruption.”

Real infrastructure means sending teams to assess our cities ,figuring out which neighborhoods & businesses are profitable or could be, & which are draining resources & are not working, and where investments can bring real growth. It means creating strategic plans with huge budgets to rebuild broken roads, bridges, water systems, and to develop new, thriving neighborhoods & businesses designed for the future.

Instead, too often what gets called “infrastructure” is just political theater, spending billions on prisons instead of schools, building border walls instead of public transit, or focusing on culture war fights that keep us divided and distracted.

Meanwhile, other countries, like China, are building smart cities, investing heavily in technology, transportation, and education, and positioning themselves to lead globally in the coming decades.

If we don’t stop confusing political distractions for real policy, we’re going to fall further behind. The future of this country depends on real leadership, real investment, and real plans, not on the endless culture wars that keep dragging us down.

We deserve better. We need better. And it’s on all of us to demand it.

I want to hear your thoughts on where we should actually start fixing America’s infrastructure. From my perspective, the first step has to be taking a hard look at our economy, specifically which businesses are truly profitable and which are actually making things worse. For example, big box stores might bring convenience but often hurt local economies and contribute to urban decay. Understanding these dynamics can help us decide where to invest, rebuild, or rethink entire systems to create healthier, more sustainable communities. What do you think America should invest heavily in to compete and actually innovate against countries like China on a global level? Where should we focus first to rebuild America for the future?

Ps: USA towns look so bad, as an American citizen, it's embarrassing for us to be one of the richest country in the world but you have places in Europe and in China that look so much better & have greater infrastructure, even our major cities are using super old infrastructure... Like the New York subway still using infrastructure from October 27, 1904.... Yikes 😬

","the cost of culture wars with  : america ’ s it ’ s living in the  where so many people culture war distractions with actual  policy . real  isn ’ t about immigration debates , statistics , or calls to “ stop corruption. ” real  means sending teams to assess our cities , figuring out which neighborhoods & businesses are profitable or could be , & which are resources & are not working , and where investments can bring real growth . it means creating strategic plans with huge budgets to rebuild roads , bridges , water systems , and to develop new , neighborhoods & businesses designed for the future . instead , too often what gets called “  ” is just political theater , spending billions on prisons instead of schools , building border walls instead of public transit , or focusing on culture war fights that keep us divided and distracted . meanwhile , other countries ,  , are building cities , investing heavily in technology , transportation , and education , and positioning themselves to globally in the coming decades . if we don ’ t stop political distractions for real policy , we ’ re going to further behind . the future of this country depends on real leadership , real investment , and real plans , not on the endless culture wars that keep us down . we deserve . we need . and it ’ s on all of us to demand it . i want to hear your thoughts on where we should actually start fixing america ’ s  . from my perspective , the first step has to be taking a look at our economy , specifically which businesses are truly profitable and which are actually making things . for example , big box stores might bring but often local economies and contribute to urban . understanding these dynamics can help us decide where to invest , rebuild , or rethink entire systems to create healthier , more communities . what do you think america should invest heavily in to compete and actually innovate against countries  on a global level ? where should we focus first to rebuild america for the future ? ps :  towns look so , as an american citizen , it 's for us to be one of the richest country in the world but you have places in europe and in  that look so much & have greater  , even our major cities are using old  ... the new york subway still using  from october 27 , 1904 .... yikes"

Also Gavin Newsom 2028,"A person can be American in the “soul” or whatever,  whether we’re in the soil illegally or legally, I think we all can agree on that. And I think that’s the message at heart when it comes to immigration. 

Someone who’s born in another country living in the US right now having illegally crossed but is a Good Samaritan who pays their taxes and maybe raises a family and in general just does good, has every right to live in America. They may have skipped a line but when that line takes an unreasonable amount of time then that’s a problem of the line and procedure. 

You don’t punish/harm someone who hasn’t really harmed anyone else. Someone jumping over a border to get from a worse to better living situation didn’t harm anyone in the line that leads to the front entrance, so why bother being cruel to an illegal person who abides by laws and puts back into the economy and society, and maybe raises a family and does good in general? 

Is the cruelty of separating families and sending good people away who deserve life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a truly necessary or righteous action for the “harm” this individual is causing/or may have caused? Can they really not just…stay? Legalize them and start documenting them and then letting them go on about their life being an American? 

Fix the line and maybe make it easier to become a citizen? Allocate money for all this? Partner with your allies to help all these people? 

DON’T send them without due process to some max security prison, or drop them off in some country they’re not from or haven’t lived in for the last 10 years, or turn their pain into some fetish such as when the government posts asmr videos of deportations totally tone deaf and unbothered about the reality of separating families and essentially kicking out good people from having a better life and situation, etc other inhumane shit we do. 

Innocent, good, non-criminal individuals aren’t a problem for shit.

WITH ALL THAT SAID: 1/10th of Americans are Hispanic Mexican. The unethical ICE shit and trump’s most fascistic actions such as deportations without due process and the cruelty/contempt for illegal immigrants, is immediately affecting 1/10th of Americans who may have personal/familial/cultural ties to the Mexico flag/country/people. A large percentage of people in SoCal are Mexican related, so ofc they’re gonna raise their support for and/or their heritage and culture up against fascism. 

Waving Mexican flags and American flags side by side is fucking amazing, based and a good message.

If that’s what they mean when they say America and make it great again, then fuck their vision of America. I trample all over it.

For many, migration is not an aspiration but a necessity. A consequence of being displaced from their homes even though it's not literal displacement.

The reasons for this displacement are deeply rooted in the actions and policies of the so-called ""developed"" world.

This support often comes in the form of an unending supply of weapons and military aid, fueling conflict and undermining any chance of stable governance. Economically, the situation is equally dire. Through the mechanisms of neocolonialism, powerful nations and multinational corporations exploit the natural resources of less developed countries, leaving local populations impoverished and dependent. These practices strip these nations of their wealth, while creating economic systems that prioritize the interests of foreign powers over the well-being of local communities.

The result is a vicious cycle: war, poverty, and instability drive people from their homes, forcing them to seek refuge elsewhere. Meanwhile, the root causes of this displacement are rarely addressed in liberal conversations about immigration.

https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1icvx4i/cmv_immigration_should_be_legal_in_all/,Immigration,CMV: Immigration should be legal in all circumstances,"This is likely a very unpopular view, but let me explain why I hold it. Let’s say we (myself and the reader) were both born and grew up in country A, for the sake of argument. And then there’s another person, let’s call them Bob, who was born and raised in country B. Any reason we propose for which Bob might not be allowed to enter country A is effectively implying that we believe people born in country A should be entitled to more rights than those born in country B, because if Bob was born in country A, he clearly would already be here so would be allowed in.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1hwtswu/why_is_it_so_difficult_to_understand_that/,immigration and economy,Why is it so difficult to understand that immigration doesn’t improve an economy for the working class and often harms it?,"Immigration lowers wage growth and lowers job vacancies. It was also shown that during Covid, when immigration restrictions were enacted, real wages increased and unemployment decreased.

Another point - if we have 300 million people (let’s assume all native born citizens) and the unemployment rate is 4.2%, then we have 12.6 million unemployed US native born citizens. And let’s say we add 100 million immigrants to the population, unemployment skyrockets, but the Fed saves the day with lower interest rates, and over 7-10 years we arrive once again back at 4.2% unemployment rate (“full employment” but with 400 million people) so we now have 16.8 million unemployed. If that unemployment is distributed evenly, we still have 12.6 million unemployed US native-born workers and 4.2 million unemployed foreign born workers. So over the long term, immigration hasn’t helped the native born population (and it hurt them over the short and medium term). But given that the foreign born workers were initially hired due to their lower wages, we may even have a higher portion of unemployed US native born workers after this period.

Further, a microcosm of this is the effects of the H-1b visa on tech wages and employment. H-1b immigration lowers employment and wages (paper showing H-1b CS degrees reduced wages of US native-born CS degrees by 2.6% - 5% and employment would have been 6.1% - 10.8% higher for US native born workers if not for H-1b). 1 in 3 tech workers are now foreign born after decades of these types of visas and them gaining permanent residency and green cards - these are high standard of living roles that could have been going to US native-born citizens and would have encouraged more investments in our own education and training systems.

And still further, when people quote statistics that immigrants are more likely to start a business, it is often because they require a tax identification number if they are here illegally in order to open a bank account and do other commerce. The study that showed they hired more employees only showed they hired 1% more and this could have just been due to the industries immigrants tend to work in/open businesses in.

And even furthermore, we only have 144 million housing units, with a shortage of 4-8 million housing units left over from 2008. We build 1.4 million housing units a year but population increases by 1.7 million people a year (66% of which is due to immigration). So it is impossible to lower housing costs at our current immigration levels, much less bring them back in line with historic norms, without reducing immigration.

Note - I, too, used to support unlimited immigration because of the propaganda I believed. But after researching the economics, it simply doesn’t make sense… unless you’re at the top of the pyramid (and seeking to exploit the working class and immigrants) or you have a savior complex and believe we can solve world poverty by bringing 750 million people living on less than $2 a day here to the US to alleviate their poverty.

Update- A lot of pushback claiming immigration is actually good for unemployment. But if immigration and population increases were good for unemployment, then why has the unemployment rate remained relatively flat since the 1950s, and increased since the 1940s in spite tens of millions of new immigrants and increased population?",DataWhiskers,AskALiberal,Against,Immigration,"Why is it so difficult to understand that immigration doesn’t improve an economy for the working class and often harms it?

But after researching the economics, it simply doesn’t make sense… unless you’re at the top of the pyramid (and seeking to exploit the working class and immigrants) or you have a savior complex and believe we can solve world poverty by bringing 750 million people living on less than $2 a day here to the US to alleviate their poverty.

Update- A lot of pushback claiming immigration is actually good for unemployment. But if immigration and population increases were good for unemployment, then why has the unemployment rate remained relatively flat since the 1950s, and increased since the 1940s in spite tens of millions of new immigrants and increased population?","why is it so to understand that immigration doesn ’ t an economy for the working class and often it ? immigration lowers wage growth and lowers job vacancies . it was also shown that during covid , when immigration restrictions were enacted , real wages increased and unemployment decreased . another point - if we have 300 million people ( let ’ s assume all native born citizens ) and the unemployment rate is 4.2 % , then we have 12.6 million us native born citizens . and let ’ s say we add 100 million immigrants to the population , unemployment skyrockets , but the fed saves the day with lower interest rates , and over 7-10 years we arrive once again back at 4.2 % unemployment rate ( “ full employment ” but with 400 million people ) so we now have 16.8 million . if that unemployment is distributed , we still have 12.6 million us native-born workers and 4.2 million foreign born workers . so over the long term , immigration hasn ’ t the native born population ( and it them over the short and medium term ) . but given that the foreign born workers were initially hired due to their lower wages , we may even have a higher portion of us native born workers after this period . further , a microcosm of this is the effects of the h-1b visa on tech wages and employment . h-1b immigration lowers employment and wages ( paper showing h-1b cs degrees reduced wages of us native-born cs degrees by 2.6 % - 5 % and employment would have been 6.1 % - 10.8 % higher for us native born workers if not for h-1b ) . 1 in 3 tech workers are now foreign born after decades of these types of visas and them permanent residency and green cards - these are high standard of living roles that could have been going to us native-born citizens and would have encouraged more investments in our own education and training systems . and still further , when people quote statistics that immigrants are more likely to start a business , it is often because they require a tax identification number if they are here in order to open a bank account and do other commerce . the study that showed they hired more employees only showed they hired 1 % more and this could have just been due to the industries immigrants tend to in/open businesses in . and even furthermore , we only have 144 million housing units , with a of 4-8 million housing units left over from 2008. we build 1.4 million housing units a year but population increases by 1.7 million people a year ( 66 % of which is due to immigration ) . so it is to lower housing costs at our current immigration levels , much less bring them back in line with historic norms , without reducing immigration . note - i , too , used to immigration because of the i believed . but after researching the economics , it simply doesn ’ t make sense… unless you ’ re at the of the pyramid ( and seeking to the working class and immigrants ) or you have a and believe we can solve world by bringing 750 million people living on less than $ 2 a day here to the us to alleviate their . update- a lot of pushback claiming immigration is actually for unemployment . but if immigration and population increases were for unemployment , then why has the unemployment rate remained relatively flat since the 1950s , and increased since the 1940s in tens of millions of new immigrants and increased population ?",Immigration_Against,"Why is it so difficult to understand that immigration doesn’t improve an economy for the working class and often harms it? Immigration lowers wage growth and lowers job vacancies. It was also shown that during Covid, when immigration restrictions were enacted, real wages increased and unemployment decreased.

Another point - if we have 300 million people (let’s assume all native  citizens) and the unemployment rate is 4.2%, then we have 12.6 million unemployed US native  citizens. And let’s say we add 100 million  to the population, unemployment skyrockets, but the Fed saves the day with lower interest rates, and over 7-10 years we arrive once again back at 4.2% unemployment rate (“full employment” but with 400 million people) so we now have 16.8 million unemployed. If that unemployment is distributed evenly, we still have 12.6 million unemployed US native- workers and 4.2 million unemployed foreign  workers. So over the long term, immigration hasn’t helped the native  population (and it hurt them over the short and medium term). But given that the foreign  workers were initially hired due to their lower wages, we may even have a higher portion of unemployed US native  workers after this period.

Further, a microcosm of this is the effects of the H-1b visa on tech wages and employment. H-1b immigration lowers employment and wages (paper showing H-1b CS degrees reduced wages of US native- CS degrees by 2.6% - 5% and employment would have been 6.1% - 10.8% higher for US native  workers if not for H-1b). 1 in 3 tech workers are now foreign  after decades of these types of visas and them gaining permanent residency and green cards - these are high standard of living roles that could have been going to US native- citizens and would have encouraged more investments in our own education and training systems.

And still further, when people quote statistics that  are more likely to start a business, it is often because they require a tax identification number if they are here illegally in order to open a bank account and do other commerce. The study that showed they hired more employees only showed they hired 1% more and this could have just been due to the industries  tend to work in/open businesses in.

And even furthermore, we only have 144 million housing units, with a shortage of 4-8 million housing units left over from 2008. We build 1.4 million housing units a year but population increases by 1.7 million people a year (66% of which is due to immigration). So it is impossible to lower housing costs at our current immigration levels, much less bring them back in line with historic norms, without reducing immigration.

https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hrccvl/immigration_is_a_good_thing/,Immigration is good,Immigration is a good thing,"I've been seeing a lot of nativist rhetoric on reddit ever since Elon and Vivek came out in support of H1Bs, and I figured I should do something about it. At it's core, most of the arguments for restricting H1-Bs or other forms of immigration are protectionist in nature.

Immigration is a good thing because:

-they aren't actually taking jobs.

-it leads to a more robust economy.

-long term American birth rate decline leading to decreased tax base and looming employee shortage.

Economists have come up with the term ""lump of labor"" fallacy to describe concerns about immigrants taking jobs. The starting assumption for people who make this fallacy is that there is a fixed number of jobs and allowing other people to take those jobs hurts American workers.

The reality is that the number of jobs are dynamic, and based on laws of supply and demand. Jobs are created and destroyed, but positive displacement occurs when sectors become more efficient and spur greater specialization.

Counterintuitively, economists have repeatedly observed positive impacts from immigration.

How can this be? The primary explanation for this has been that:

high-skilled foreign workers are complements for American workers, which means that companies have some roles that they cannot fill with American workers and others that can be filled by American workers. That is, American high-skilled workers and foreign high-skilled workers may possess different skillsets that are effective when combined together. For example, to create an artificial intelligence robotics department, a company might require a highly specialized skillset that it cannot find in the United States, so it hires a foreign worker to lead the department. However, the department needs additional workers to be on the team, and these are filled by American workers. This means that when a company cannot hire high-skilled foreign workers to create the department, then the additional department jobs for Americans workers are also lost.

What actually happens with increased immigration restrictions is that companies decide to offshore, and simply go directly to other countries to find the hires they want instead of attracting immigrants to the states. With less immigration restrictions, the long term shows greater job creation and increased productivity.

Besides bring labor, immigrants bring exchange of goods and services with them and this is relevant to the next point.

Several states are currently facing low birth rates and will have a decreased tax base as a result. Simply put, a critical mass of people is needed to maintain a society and ensure that ample goods and services are provided.

That is where immigrants can come in. Immigrants don't just work, they also have to spend money on housing, food, gas, cars, clothing, etc. This also spurs economic activity.

They also pay taxes, and they can't immediately access social services. To see a practical example of how immigration helped with a population deficit, one can simply look at how successful Singapore is.

Some of the above arguments, especially to those in tech, may fall flat because of layoffs. The thinking is that if there is currently an oversupply of labor, why bring in more people?

To see how ruinous this thinking be, we can look at medicine. I am simplifying the story here, but about 30 years ago there was predicted to be an oversupply of doctors. The medical field intervened, and increased the barriers to entry to try to protect physician wages.

Among many other protectionist measures in the medical field, one of those barriers entry remains how difficult it is for international medical graduates to work in the US. People who have already been trained and are competent doctors and do not need money invested in them to start contributing to the economy, often end up having to pursue allied health professions and are shut out of being doctors entirely.

In the short term, doctors succeeded. They command high wages, but this had negative consequences down the line. Today, restrictive immigration practices are one of many reasons contributing to a physician shortage. The physician shortage has wide ranging effects and looks like increased burnout, greater patient uncertainty as to when they get their next appointment, increased costs, decreased access to care for rural patients, and a general muted productivity in medicine as to what it could be.

Hopefully, this post addresses a lot of the arguments made on reddit.","immigration is a thing i 've been seeing a lot of nativist on reddit ever since  and vivek came out in of h1bs , and i figured i should do something about it . at it 's core , most of the arguments for restricting h1-bs or other forms of immigration are protectionist in nature . immigration is a thing because : -they are n't actually taking jobs . -it to a more economy . -long term american birth rate to decreased tax base and looming employee . economists have come up with the term `` lump of labor '' to describe about  taking jobs . the starting assumption for people who make this is that there is a fixed number of jobs and allowing other people to take those jobs american workers . the reality is that the number of jobs are , and based on laws of supply and demand . jobs are created and destroyed , but displacement occurs when sectors become more and spur greater specialization . counterintuitively , economists have repeatedly observed impacts from immigration . how can this be ? the primary explanation for this has been that : high-skilled foreign workers are for american workers , which means that companies have some roles that they can not fill with american workers and others that can be filled by american workers . that is , american high-skilled workers and foreign high-skilled workers may possess different skillsets that are when combined together . for example , to create an artificial robotics department , a company might require a highly specialized skillset that it can not find in the united states , so it hires a foreign worker to the department . however , the department needs additional workers to be on the team , and these are filled by american workers . this means that when a company can not hire high-skilled foreign workers to create the department , then the additional department jobs for americans workers are also . what actually happens with increased immigration restrictions is that companies decide to offshore , and simply go directly to other countries to find the hires they want instead of attracting  to the states . with less immigration restrictions , the long term shows greater job creation and increased productivity . besides bring labor ,  bring exchange of goods and services with them and this is relevant to the next point . several states are currently facing low birth rates and will have a decreased tax base as a result . simply put , a mass of people is needed to maintain a society and ensure that goods and services are provided . that is where  can come in .  do n't just , they also have to spend money on housing , food , gas , cars , clothing , etc . this also spurs  activity . they also pay taxes , and they ca n't immediately access social services . to see a practical example of how immigration with a population deficit , one can simply look at how singapore is . some of the above arguments , especially to those in tech , may flat because of layoffs . the thinking is that if there is currently an oversupply of labor , why bring in more people ? to see how this thinking be , we can look at medicine . i am the story here , but about 30 years ago there was predicted to be an oversupply of doctors . the medical field intervened , and increased the barriers to entry to try to physician wages . among many other protectionist measures in the medical field , one of those barriers entry remains how it is for international medical graduates to in the us . people who have already been trained and are competent doctors and do not need money invested in them to start contributing to the economy , often end up having to pursue allied health professions and are shut out of being doctors entirely . in the short term , doctors . they command high wages , but this had consequences down the line . today , immigration practices are one of many reasons contributing to a physician . the physician has wide ranging effects and looks increased burnout , greater uncertainty as to when they get their next appointment , increased costs , decreased access to care for rural patients , and a general muted productivity in medicine as to what it could be . hopefully , this post addresses a lot of the arguments made on reddit ."

We need the immigrants.,"I really do feel for young adults today. All of the structures that young adults have always relied on to get their lives and careers going have basically been left to rot.

But anyone trying to hire young Americans for work today is going to have a lot of trouble. I helped an elderly family member move out of their large house, and they needed a lot of help with cleaning, packing, light painting, moving, yard work, etc.

So, we hired young people, first through a staffing agency, then through job boards. We consistently paid $20-25 per hour, and it was a complete shit show. No one would do anything if you didn't walk them through every step. Even if you did, they would be on their phones two seconds after you leave the room. I found one guy wandering around my neighbor's yard listening to music on his phone about five minutes after I re-explained a job to him.

Then there was the drugs. Half of them looked like they were on pills of some kind when they showed up. One guy, who was the best worker we had on day one, shot up in the bathroom and passed out on day 2. Shit turned up missing.

Enter the immigrants. We saw a post on a job site for three early 20's siblings recently arrived from Nicaragua. They said they spoke only very little English. I speak some Spanish, so I thought I'd give them a chance, and I paid them the same 20/hr.

Holy shit. They work like a whirlwind. They all know how to paint, how to use a drill, lawn and garden equipment, etc. I can just motion to a job and come back to it executed basically perfectly. The sister was moving around 50lb dumbbells nonchalantly. When they got done removing wallpaper early and couldn't find me, they started washing windows on their own.

They all have their cell phones on them and they can all handle them. They all take brief calls, look things up, watch instructional videos in Spanish on youtube, play music, etc., but it's never a problem. They just use the phone like a normal person, then get back to work. With the young American workers, the moment they looked at their phone, they weren't going to stop until you told them to.

As we sought out other recent immigrants to work, we had similar experiences consistently. They just tend to be smart, clean cut, polite and hard working.

I know that there are highly capable and intelligent young adults in this country, but you really have to sift through the ocean of chaff to find them. This isn't brain surgery work and doesn't pay like it is, but 20/hr is not bad for a part time, flexible gig that provides refreshments. This isn't a HCOL area.

I don't agree with abusing immigrants or paying them any less than you would an American in the same job. I also don't fault the young American people. They have their own maze to run and they need to decide how they are going to run it.

But we need immigrants. The world can't stop turning, and as we lose skills as a country, we need people who have them. They are a viable option. It's also not their fault we spend trillions on war and then let our schools and empty housing rot.

Hey genius, the country didn't have an immigration policy back then because we prided ourselves on giving a home to immigrants in need. There were literally no laws in place governing immigration. Your ancestors came from another country to provide you with a better life and your response is to close the door on those doing the exact same thing. Dope.

The "" migrant crisis"" seems to be the main rallying cry of the  this election cycle despite the fact that we have so much data that directly disproves that narrative. It's not even a new or unique talking point because it's literally just rehashed xenophobia from the past. The same was said about the Irish people when they immigrated en masse due to the Irish Potato Famine. That's where we got the term ""Paddy wagon"" from. Then after the Civil War when black people started having more unrestricted freedom to move throughout the country many stereotypes were created to fear monger over black people assimilating into the country. Then post WWII when a large number of Italians immigrated to the country and a lot of stereotypes were made about them. That's where we get the word ""Wop people shouldn't care, and those who do I'm convinced are racist, dumb, or both.

Migrants are not dangerous. Many studies have been conducted on the topic and have always shown that migrants are 11x less likely to commit a crime. Think about it logically, why would a person commit a crime and attract attention to themselves? That would mean they get deported if they commit crimes.

2. This is old anti-immigrstion propaganda. As I stated above America has a habit of making shit up about the hot new group that is immigrating into the country.

3. Immigration helps the economy. Many studies have shown that immigration helps the economy. More mouths to feed increases food production, which creates more jobs in the food sector. More people means more houses/apartments need to get built making more people more likely to live in said homes. And more bodies means more hands to work.
